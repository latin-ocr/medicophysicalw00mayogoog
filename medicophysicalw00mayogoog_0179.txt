of finer matter compacted with greater continuity than
the medium by which the rays of light are transmitted.
For we must suppose a very subtle and ethereal matter
which, interwoven with the nitroaerial particles, oc-
cupies and fills up all the interstices of the atmosphere‚
and that by its impulse visible forms are propagated.
In fact, the structure of the eye is so tendet and
delicate that it is able to perceive those very gentle
blows of ethereal matter, imperceptible to the other
semes, and besides to distinguish the variation in its
pressure and rhythrn on which vision and colour depend.
And indeed it seems to be owing to the extreme
tenuity ol the medium of vision that the image of a
lamp is conveyed to such a great distance without any
delay. For the visible form ola luminous body is
transmitted far beyond the lirnit of its light, and
probably with a swilter motion than the rays of light
are transmitted through the air.

That the image ot an illuminated body is trans·
mitted by the impulse of this special medium, and by
a motion different from the action of light, I have en-
· deavoured to show above. Let us therefore now
consider next, how it is that the medium of vision is
struck. On this point l was for some time in a
difficulty as to whether it is by the impulse ol the
illuminated body or ol the luminous particles that the
medium of vision is affected. For I think we must
maintain either that the luminous particles imping-
ing on the suriace ol the illuminated body, impress
such an impulse upon it as is fitted, when conveyed
through the medium of vision and by its instru-
mentality to the eye, for presenting an image of
the illuminated body, or (as seems t0 me more prob·
able) that the nitro-aerial and luminous particles
falling upon the illuminated body, acquire themselves
