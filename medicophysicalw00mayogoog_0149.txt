tions caused by the effervescence will rise in the
form 01 bubbles to the top 01 the glass and constitute
the air there, which, gradually increasing, will de·
press the underlying water. Let the glass, when it
is completely filled with air 01 this kind, be raised a
little, that the 11011 8101111105, which are to be removed
110111 the liquid, may escape 110111 it, care however
being taken that the mouth 01 the glass be not raised
above the liquid. And so we shall see that air which
occupied the whole glass, gradually condense, and the
underlying liquid rise into its place. And yet this
air will not all become liquid, 101 the 81355 will be
always about one-fourth filled with it; and this air,
however long kept, even in the coldest weather‚ will
never be condensed into a liquid. If the 11011 8101111105
be placed under the mouth 01 the glass while it is still-
inverted and put a second time into it, air will be
produced anew, a certain part 01 which will never
become liquid. So that the 81355 will be about half·
filled with exhalatione that will never be condensed.
li oil 01 vitriol mixed with water be substituted
101 spirit 01 nitre, or 11 3 very sluggish fermentation
be excited in the manner described, or also if the
iron globules be allowed to remain in the glass 1013

day or 1110, then the air generated in this way will
scarcely suffer condensation at all. For the partial
contraction 01 the air in the aforesaid glass was due

to this, that the exhalations produced by violent
fermentation were agitated with a very rapid motion,
which, gradually abating, the air was reduced to
smaller bulk; while, 11 the fermentation has been
mild and has gone on 101 3 10118 time, the exhalatione
generated later will take up and fill the place leit by
those previously condensed, so that the air will
scarcely suffer any condensation at all.
