region is extremely cold and that vapours to some
extent freeze in it. F or the air in the middle region
is at least as cold as that which rests on the top of the
loltier mountains, which in fact does not permit the
snow there to melt even in mid-summer, as was
remarked by the illustrious Descartes. But 1 have
endeavoured to show above that intense cold and the
congelation of vapours are due to nitro-aerial particles.
Further, that nitro-aerial particles are crowded in the
highest region oi the air seems to be confirmed by the
blue colour of the sky; foras nitro-aerial particles,
when urged with swiftest motion, glow and flame, so
when they move more slowly‚ or when their motion
ceases altogether, they assume a blue colour. And it
is an indication of this that the flame ol sulphur is
blue, lor the nitro-aerial particles do not move so
swiltly in it as in other flames, as has been elsewhere
stated. And hence it would seem that when flame is
about to expire in subterranean crypts, or even from
the lack oi sulphureous nutriment, the nitro-aerial
particles in it do not shine brightly as in other
circumstances, but take a blue colour ou account of
their diminished motion. To these I add, lastly, that
iron and other very rigid substances of the same kind
appear blue when polished on account of the nitro·
adrial particles densely fixed in them.

These things being admitted, it is reasonable to
suppose that ae'rial particles when deprived, whether
by the burning ol fire, or by the breathing ol animals,
or in any other way, of their nitro-aerial particles and
consequently of their weight and elasticity, are driven
upwards by the pressure of the rest ol the air, and
that they ascend until they arrive where nitro-aerial
particles moving with the greatest rapidity constitute
the clement of fire r further, that the ae'rial particles on
