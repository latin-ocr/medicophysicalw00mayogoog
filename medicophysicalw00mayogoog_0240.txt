And this will be made still clearer by what is to be
said below. Still l will not deny that the movement
of the lungS, and the compression of the blood-vessels
occasioned by the fall of the thorax in expiration,
contribute not a little to send the blood through the
lungs; but it is by no means to be supposed that this
is the only use of respiration.

Hence somethink that respiration serves a further
purpose, that ol churning, forsooth, and dividing into
the smallest particles the thicker venous blood. For
otherwise (as they say) the blood would be separated
into distinct parts, namely, serum anda purple sedi·
ment. But neither is this the chief use ol respiration.

For any air, however impure, would suffice for such
a movement of the lungs and sor the churning of the
blood; but air vitiated by contagion, or air which has
often been sent out lrorn the lungs, is by no means
suitable lor respiration and the support of lif . With
respect, then, to the use ol respiration, it may be
affirmed that an aerial something essential to life,
whatever it may be, passes into the mass of the blood.
And thus air driven out of the lungs, these vital
particles having been drained from it, is no longer fit
for breathing again. But this will be made clearer by
the following experiment.

For is, by means ol bellows attached to the trachea
of an animal, a dog lor example, the lungs are in-
flated, but in such a way that, through openings
made here and there at their extremitieS, some oi the
air may pass out, the loss of which must be supplied
by the bellows that the lungs may not collapse; iu
this case,l say, the animal will live. And yet that
sort ol agitation ol the blood cannot take place in
lungs which are kept inflated to the utmost. More·
over, though the movement ol the lungs entirely
