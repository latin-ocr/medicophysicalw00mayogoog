On Muscular Motr'on and Anr'rnal Spirr'ts 233

undergoes contraction‚ it is probable that uot so much
the fibres, as the fibrils inserted transversely into them,
chiefly undergo contractiori, as will be shown alter·
wards

As to the swelling of the fleshy libres observed close
toa ligature tied upon them, that seems to be pro·
duced by the blood passing through on theone side
and on the other, but not from the interrupted motion
of the animal spirits. Foris such a swelled fibre be
wounded, blood immediately escapes in abundance.
Resides, that tumour remains constant at the ligature
even when the muscle is relaxed and is no longer
contracted, and theri the animal spirits are not sup·
posed to advance out ol the tendinous libres, but, on
the contrary, to retire into them.

But so farI think we may agree with the learned
author, forI believe that the contractiori of the
muscles is produced by particles of different kinds
mixed with one another iii the structure of the muscle‚
and mutually effervescing, as will be shown below.

Iani quite aware that the learned Dr Steno‚ in his
Myologz'oe Specr'rnen, published not very long ag0, ’
thinks that there is no need that any elastic matter
should be added in order to start the contractiori of
the muscles; which, in this learned author's opinion,
can be effected by a mere change ol their form.
Thus, “If a muscle should change froni an oblique-
angled parallelogram into a parallelogram the angles
ol which are less acute, as is supposed to happen in
the contractiori of the muscle, then it will be coii-
tracted iri length, and will also swell up, without the
addition of any new matter ” ; as is shown in Plate 111,
F ig. 1, in which, let a, b, c, d, be the niuscle, c, d, a,f‚

the same contracted, and although it be of the same
magnitude as before, and has had no new matter
