yet I do not think they exist in celestial lires, as I
shall endeavour to show below.

For whether we consider flame as sharp, caustic,
and in the highest degree corrosive„ or as possessing
an extremely penetrating and dissolving power, or
finally as being ruddy and bright‚ in all of which
qualities the true essence of fire consists, all these‚I
say, seem to proceed from its nitro-aerial spirit, since
the particles of the latter are in the highest degree
subtle, sharp‚ and caustic. For it has been shown
above that the extremely corrosive and acrid nature
of nitrous spirit is due to the nitro-aerial and fiery
particles which reside in it. And, indeed, fire and
the spirit of nitre are so like in respect to their
caustic virtue, that it can scarcely be doubted that
their extremely corrosive nature is due to particles
of the ¹same kind, namely, to the nitro-aerial and fiery
spirit which resides in both.

Besides, nitro-aerial particles when in very great
commotion become red like fire and glisten, as is
clearly seen in the spirit of nitre which is ruddy dur·
ing distillation. Nay‚ that every kind of light pro-
ceeds from the motion of the nitro-aerial particles
will be shown below3 while, on the other hand, the
gentler sulphureous particles, however violently
agitated, appear less fitted for assuming the keen
and eminently destructive nature of fire.

[f we consider attentively the nature of flame and
reflect upon the character of the change which the
fiery particles undergo on being ignited, we can form
no other conception than that the kindling of the

igneous particles consists in their extremely rapid
motion. Why then should we not suppose that
saline particles are specially fit for the production of
fire? For since they are extremely solid, subtle, and
