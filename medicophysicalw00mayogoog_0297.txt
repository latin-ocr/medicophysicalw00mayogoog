On MuscuIar Motion and Animal Spirits 261

sensitive function‚ we need to constrict the head and
brain, as any one can find out in his own case: and
that constriction ol the brain seems to proceed to
some extent from the harder meningas contracting
itself more strongly. Certainly, in great anger, when
we strive to the utmost of our power to repel or to

avenge an injury, the said ,membrane as if seized
with convulsions, seems to constrict the brain:
whence it happens that the nitroaarial spirits, lorced
into the brain and thence into the nervous system,
produce certain involuntary movements and con-
vulsive tremors.

I further add that it is probable that sneezing is
produced by the dura mater contracting itsell more
strongly, and forcibly driving the animal spirits into
the nerves devoted to respiration3 for it is certainly
established that the membranes of the brain are
primarily affected in sneezing.

Further, I am not sure whether the pulsation os the
heart, or even the respiration, both of which are
periodic‚ do not depend on the pulsation ol the harder
meningas surrounding the cerebellum.

Further, it may be held that epilepsy‚ as also
apoplexy, sometimes arise from the convulsion or
from the paralysis of the said membrane : lor in these
diseases the brain itself is sometimes found free from
any sign of disease, and those substances which cousist
ol volatile salt and volatile sulphur, as oil of amber
and such like, are specially useful in these diseases:
sor it is not to be supposed that the saline-sulphureous
liquids penetrate the brain itself and strengthen it,
inasmuch as sulphureous substances seem to be
hostile to the brain, and when taken too quickly, rushin g
into the cloisters of the hrain not unfrequeutly cause
convulsions, as we have elsewhere indicated. But
