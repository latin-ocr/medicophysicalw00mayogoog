On Mascular Motion and Am'mal Spirits 28 3

affected by the heat ol the lamp; but that con-
traction of the string is not produced in the common
way, but the string seems to undergo a spontaneous
movement, and to run together into itself in the
manner of fibrils-a very pleasant sight. But if the
contracted string be removed from the lamp it can
be drawn out to its former length with very little
effort. As to the cause from which the contractiori
of the string proceedS, we may believe that the nitro-
ae'rial particles, bursting out of the flame of the lamp,
produce that contractiori of the string; for we have
elsewhere shown that igneous particles oi any kind
(and it is by them that the said string is contracted)
are nothing else than nitro-aerial particles in a state
of motion. But the contractior] ol the string seems
to proceed from its being twisted by the nitro-a‘e'rial
particles: for if one end ol the cord is left free, or if
it is held less firmly between the fingers and brought
towards the lamp, we shall see the cord rotated
pretty quickly. For as the nitro-a'e'rial particles
bursting out of the lamp with the circumgyratory
motion proper to them act on the said cord, they
drive it round with their own motion and twist it.
And it is certainly probable that the contraction
of the fibrils is accomplished in a not very dissimilar
way: for the fibrils, in which the contractiori primarily
takes place seem, in as lar as the microscope can
help us, to be very like an extremely slender music
string. Resides, we suppose that the contractiori oi
the fibrils is caused by nitro-aeria] particles set in
motion, and even pretty intensely warmed in the
motor parts. Wherefore, if a coarse and thick cord
undergoes contractiori when touched by nitro-aerial
particles, how much more should the extremely
slender fibrils, fashioned with the highest skill, follow
