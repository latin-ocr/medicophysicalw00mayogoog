inverted and placed under the orifice of the other
glass, and raised in it in the following manner.
A transverse rod has to be attached, from the first, to
the inner sides of the glass, as is seen in Plate V.,
Fig. 4. And let a string bc so suspended from the
rod that both its ends, drawn from under the ori-
fice of the glass, hang outside. Then one end of
the string is to be tied to the bottom of the glass that
is to be raised, and the other end pulled till the glass
rises above the surface of the water inside. When the
water has fallen out of the glass which has thus been
pulled up in an inverted position, and air has taken its
place, 155 this glass be pulled down by means of 55-
other string previously fastened to its mouth, and taken
out of the other glass in such a way that its mouth
may remain continuously inverted; and then, lastly,
the air contained 15 15 may be transferred to theglass
first described, in the manner already shown.
Although air generated from the aforesaid fermen-
tation possesses no less clastic force than common air,
it does not on that account follow that it is really air
-viz., such as possesses vital and igneous particles.
For that air in which 55 animal or a light has expired
possesses clastic force in an equal degree with inviolate
air, and yet it is destitute of nitro-aerial and vital
particles. But 15 order to determine whether this air
generated anew is fit for sustaining life or not, let ⁴the
following experiment be performed. But before this
can be done, 15 15 first of all necessary that air of that
sort be generated in sufficient abundance, which can
be done as follows without any great waste of the
aforesaid liquid. Let a sufficiently large glass be im-
mersed in water and filled with it, and let it remain
inverted. And now let the air generated ina small
glass, in the manner described, be transferred to this
