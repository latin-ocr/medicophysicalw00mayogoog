On Sal Nitrum and Matre-Amal Spina ¹73

be dissolved in the said waters‚ I think the source of
the error lies in the fact that the decoction was ruade
in a vessel‚ used lor such purposes‚ in which perhaps
at some time a fixed salt had been boiled ; so that the
solution ol the sulphur might be caused by a small
portion ol the fixed salt with which the vessel was
imbued.

It is generally believed that if silver be immersed in
the hot Bath waters it will receive a yellow tinge, just
as if it were put into a solution of sulphur ; and hence
the common belief that these thermal waters are
impregnated with sulphur; but the contrary ol this
has been ascertained by experiment. For silver put in
the baths does not become at all red or yellow, but
rather black. But the error seems to arise from this,
that the keepers of the baths are in the habit ol
tinging and as it were gilding silver coins witha
saline-sulphureous mud such as is found everywhere
in sewers, and then selling them lor a small sum to
visitors, as coins coloured by the waters ol the baths.

It should also be noticed here that a certain
bituminous mud and a small quantity ol common
sulphur are usually thrown out along with the gush-
ing waters of the thermal springs; yet these eithe
float on the surface of the waters or lie at the bouum,
but are in nowise dissolved in the said waters.

Nor arethe said thermal waters impregnated with
armoniae salt, as some have supposed3 for if salt ol
tartaris put into a solution of sal armoniae, the simply
saline volatile salt (of which sal armoniae partly

. consists), released from the fetters ol the acid salt with

which it was previously united, will instantly rise in
vapours and will soon betray its presence by assailing

the nostrils which approach it. But this in noway
happens with the thermal waters.
