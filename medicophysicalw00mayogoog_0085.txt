ticles which, when whirled round and hot, separated
from each other the particles ol these glowing sub-
stances and opened up their structure, now, when they
cease to move in consequence of encountering cold,
are fixed like wedges or very solid spikelets in their
potes. Things are hardened by thern when fixed in
this manner, and indeed cold seems to close the potes
of things in this way only.

But that ultro-aeria] particles reside in iron made
rigid in this way, is evident from the fact, that this iron
acquires the property of giving out fire when struck
by a flint. For we must suppose that the sparks
struck out from steel are caused by igneo-nitrous
particles ol the steel bursting forth with extreme
velocity on account ol the violence of the blow.
Indeed we perceive that the fire of these sparks is
very like burning nitre, and that they burn very
readily though struck out from the steel in a place
where there is no air-which is certainly a clear
prool that there are nitro-aerial particles in steel. So
that to strike fire from it there is no need-as in
other cases where fire is produced—for nitro-aeria}
particles to be supplied from the air. It corrobo-
rates this view that if heated iron cools slowly, the
igneo-nitrous particles gradually extricate themselves
and escape through the open pores of the iron (for these
are not, asin the previous case, contracted by the cold) ;
so that the iron, from want ol igneo-nitrous par·
ticles, becomes less rigia, and unfit to give out fire
when struck. And what the ingenious Dr R. Hooke
has set down in his Micrographia is not opposed
to this-to wit, that the sparks of steel‚ after their
extinction, are nothing but small globules or minute
vitrified bits of steel. For lt must not on that account
be thought that little morsels of metal take the form
