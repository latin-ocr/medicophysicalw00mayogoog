On Sal Nitrum aud Miro-Ainirl Spin't 45

sulphur and salt, fixed or volatile, are particularly
adapted for producing fermentation. Ol this kind
are yolk of egg and all sorts of gall of animals, as
also soap—all ol which when mixed with any farina-
ceous mass make it swell and ferment in cooking.
But the fermentative nature of the things named
seems to be due to this, that in cooking, the nitro-a'e'rial
particles ol the fire meet their saline-sulphureous par·
ticles and effervesce with them.

I add further, that the glow or warmth which
arises in nearly everything when fermenting‚ appears
to be caused by nitro-a'e'rial spirit, as has been already
indicated. For 1 think it is clear, from what has been
said elsewhere, that a most intense and fiery heat
proceeds from nitro-aerial particles when thrown into
very rapid motion. And indeed we must suppose
that heat of every kind depends upon the same
particles when briskly agitated, lor heat and fire
must be supposed to result from the agitation with
different degrees ol motion of the same kind of
particles. For in glowing substances ol all sorts the
presence of nitro-a'e'rial particles is shown by suffi-
cieutly clear signs.

As to the heat resulting from lire and from the
fermentation ol things, it has now been shown that
it is caused by the motion of nitro-aerial particles
As to the heat of antagonistic salts when mixed
together, we must imagine that it too is caused by
nitro-a'e'rial spirit. For it has already been shown
that aeid and corrosive liquids are produced by the
action ol nitro-adria] particles, and that nitro-aerial
spirit resides in them as in a fitting subject ; although
1 shall endeavour to show below that the heat pro-
duced by the fermentation of contrary salts depends
also upon nitro-aerial particles supplied by the air.
