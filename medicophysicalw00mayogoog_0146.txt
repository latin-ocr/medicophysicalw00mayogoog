things than for sustaining animal life. Nor indeed
is the mass of the blood in any way suitable for pro·
ducing flame; for although it consists of sulphureous
particles, yet these are held so firmly in the embrace
of the saline ones that blood will not burn, even when
thrown into the fire. But if any fire of this sort were
kindled in the mass of the blood when the blood
rushes forth from a divided artery, the flame would
certainly reveal itself by its own light. For it is not
to be thought that any llarne is ever kindled which is
not luminous and also somewhat caustic and destruc·
tive, unless one is disposed to palm off furnes for
flame. Nor is it credible that the vital flame is
extinguished in the blood as it rushes out ol the
vessels, for the air by blowing on it is fitted rather to
excite than to extinguish fire. And lastly, what are
we to think oi the vital fire os aquatic animals? It
must indeed be fierce and invincible to burn under
water and be such as the whole ocean cannot quench.
The existence of subterranean fires is not yet estab-
lished; it is much less probable that there are sub·
aqueous lires. With respect to a lucid soul inhabiting
the brains of animals, Ι ask how it is possible that this
light which is supposed to enlighten with its rays the
whole brain and nervous system, should never be seen
by the eye. Truly, fires os this sort and new lights,
no less in Anatomy than in Religion, have always
seemed to me vain and fanatical.

With respect to the fermentation ol the blood we
note further, that if the saline-sulphureous particles
in the mass ol the blood have been too much elevated,
the nitro-aerial particles mixed with thern will give
-rise toa very impetuous effervescence and to lebrile
heat. And thus it is that an ulcer ol the lungs pro-
duces a hectic lever; for the nitro-aerial particles,
