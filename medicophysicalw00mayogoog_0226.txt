expanded. And here, following not so much the
authority of writers as the truth,I shall state brielly
what the thing itsell teaches

The received opinion is that of the intercostal
muscles, only the external serve to dilate the chest,
while the internal, on the other hand, contract it.
But it seems to me more reasonable to suppose that
the chest is dilated simultaneously by both. And
that this may be better understood l shall premise
the following observations.

We may affirm that the raising of the ribs dilates
the space within the chest and that their depression
diminishes it. For we suppose here (what any one
may see in a skeleton) that the ribs (especially the
lower, which contribute most to the dilatation os the
chest) are not articulated to the spine and sternum at
right angles, but that the angles below the ribs are a
little less than right angles 3 so that if a rib is raised,
its articulations with the spine and sternum will
approach to right angles. We assert further that
the chest is dilated by the ribs when raised to right
angles. For letus imagine a number os arches lying
upon a plane, as represented in Plate ΙΙ., F ig. 1 3 while
they remain in this position there is no space at all
between the arches and the plane, for we suppose that
they are in mutual contaet. Il, however, the said
arches are raised somewhat above the plane, there is
a certain intervening space, and, in proportion as they
rise towards right angles, the spaces between them
and the plane become greater. Now it is precisely
the same in the caseos the chest. For let a, in the
figure be the spine; b, the sternum; and c, c, c, c, the
ribs. Let the plane between the spine and the
sternum be the mediastinum, or any imaginary plane
dividing the thorax into equal parts: how much the
