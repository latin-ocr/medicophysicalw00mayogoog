movement. It certainly seems to have been arranged
by the good providences of nature that when the
saline-sulphureous particles are nearly exhausted by
vigils, what remains of these particles should be
reserved for the natural functions-those really
necessary for life. Hence it is necessary that the
membrane surrounding the brain should sometimes

cease from its motion, so that the small remaining ’

= portion of motive particles should be employed for
the motion of rhe membrane surrounding the cere-
bellum, and the other natural functione. For it must
be noticed that although the spontaneous animal
functions which are performed by means of the brain
arc for a time interrupted during sleep, yet the function
of the cerebellum aud the natural motions go on no
less, nay, rather better, when we are asleep than when
we are awake.

lt goes to confirm what has been said, that when
we have recently awakened from sleep we feel our
brain turgid with blood and somewhat heavy. The
reason of this seems to be that in sleep, the membranes
of the braiu ceasing from their pulsation, the motion
of the blood is not promoted by the contractiori of
the said membraues as when one is awake, aud there-
fore the blood must be somewhat detained, and
stagnate iu the membranes of the brain. Bur mean-
while during sleep the arterial blood, its passage
through the brain being to some extent obstructed‚
is carried in greater abundauce to the cerebellum3
hence the nitro-aerial particles pass iu sleep in greater
abundauce to the cerebellum aud the nerves arising
from it, and thus it is that the natural fonctions
presided over by the cerebellum are better performed
in sleep than when one is awalte. What has been
said also gives us a reason why, in diseases character·
