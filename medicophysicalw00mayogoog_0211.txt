the tongue, the taste ol vitriol will be manifest
enough. Indeed uitroaiirial spirit, after a lapse ol
time, unitos and effervesces with the ruetallic mineral
or saline-sulphureous marchasite (such as vitriol is
usually made from) which is mixed in the said sand,
and at last turns it into vitriol in the manner
described in another place.

Let us next consider how not only the hot springs
ol Bath but all thermal springs acquire their heat.
With regard to the heat of thermal springs, Ι cannot
agree with those who maintain that their heat is due
to warmth communicated by subterranean fire. For
if any fire of this sort burned in the bowels of the
earth, it would certainly betray itself by its flame
bursting out somewhere; since indeed a continual
influx of air is absolutely necessary ior the mainten·
ance ol fire. But granting that there are subterranean
fires, how is it,l ask, that they are not extinguished
by the waters which they are supposed to beat?
And whence should the material be supplied for
maintaining a fire so vast and enduring?

Wherefore, since it is not probable that the hot
springs are heated by subterranean fires, we may
maintain with our learned countryman, Jordan, that
the warming ol the hot springs originates in
fermentation excited somewhere in the bowels of the
earth. But to understand how this fermentation is
produced the following must be premised.

In the first place, then, it may reasonably be
supposed that at any rate most fountains derive their
origin from rain-water. For it is not probable that
any of thern are derived, as is generally believed,
from the sea ; lor who can entertain the idea that the
gushing waters which burst lorth from the summits
ol the loftiest mountains have their origin in the
