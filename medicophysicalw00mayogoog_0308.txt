aerial particles cannot now, as at other times, pass
through the spleen on account of its obstruction,
they are carried into the stomach, the pancreas, and
the other viscera ol digestion without any moderatiori
or control. But the digestion of the food and chyme
is carried on too quickly by these particles mixed in
too great abundance with the chyme in the stomach
and other parts of the abdomen, and consequently
very impetuous and flatulent fermentations must
arise.

Further, as the nitro-aerial spirits cannot be dis·
charged into the obstructed spleen, it is probable that
they to some extent regurgitate towards the hrain
and the cerebellum, whence it comes to pass that the
motion of the animal spirits will be perverted, and
consequently the brain and the animal economy
perturbed‚ as often happens in hypochondriac
affections3 although this rnay also be produced by
another cause, as will be set forth below.

And besides, this also points in the same way that,
namely, the spleen in infants is florid and scarlet,
although later it acquires a black-blue colour. For
that difference of colour seems to come lrorn this,
that in inlants the nitro-aerial particles come only
sparingly to the spleen, so that as yet scarcely any
fermentation is excited in it, as will be more fully
stated presently. But the reason why the spleen
does not perform its iunction in inlants seenrs to be
this. The foetus in the uterus, as also for some time
after birth, has hardly any, at all events no violent
exercise, and the heart and the organs of respiration
do not as yet need to work at all hard: for these
natural fonctions are specially increased in violent
motion of the body, as has been shown above. Hence
the nitro-aerial particles are transmitted through the
