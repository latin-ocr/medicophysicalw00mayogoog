as nitro-aerial particles when they slowly enter the
pores of the earth encounter there saline-sulphureous
particles, immature indeed, in an obscure fermentation
on which, as has been shown elsewhere, the lifeof'
plants depends; so the same nitro-aerial particles-
when introduced more profusely into the mass of ther
blood by the action oi the lungs, andmixed in their
minutest parts with its saline-sulphureous particles,
brought toa state of active vigour, produce avery
marked fermentation such as is requisite for animal
lile. For it is to be noted that blood consists of
the same. particles as earth but in a more exalted state,
For as immature sulphur, when closely combined with
the seeds of a fixed salt, composes earthy matter, as has
been said elsewhere, so the mass of the blood is
made up of saline-sulphureous particles raised to a
suitable volatility, and hence it is that both have
the same colour-to wit, a dark purple. Indeed 1
attempted to show above that nearly all fermentatione
ol natural things result from the motion of nitro-aerial
particles; and in fact I have no doubt at all that the
effervescence of the blood is due to the samecauset
accordingly when respiration is arrested, the effer--
vescence ol the blood immediately ceases and animal. .
life is extinguished.

And what confirms still more the view just stated is
the lact that the blood which entered the lungs with.
a dark colour, returns from them more florid and.
ruddy, as arterial blood is, as was observed by the
illustrious Lower in vivisections. He also showed
that that change made in the mass of the blood is,
caused, not so much by its being triturated in the.
lungs as by the air being mixed with it. For when .
venons blood is placed in a vessel, the upper surface·
which is exposed to the air acquires a scarlet and
