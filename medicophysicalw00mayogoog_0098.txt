matter? But with a view to a further conjecture on
this extremely recondite subject I think it should first
be maintained in regard to motion in general that it
can be produced in no other way than by impulse.
For as regards a natural inclination of inanimate things
by which (in popular belief) they begin this or that
movement spontaneously, I simply cannot understand
it. For I do not know how an elective movement ol
that kind can exist without intelligence or at least
sensation. Our opinion indeed is that inanimata
things have no inclination‚ but that instead ol it there
is that power merely by which every thing remains
always as sar as may be in the same state. But a
power of this kind implics nothing more than that
inanimate things are unable to dispose ol themselves
orto alter their state, but are altogether dependent
upon other things. Whenever then a body is at rest
⁸ nothing else can be imagined than that it will remain
lor ever in a state of rest, unless as the ingenious
Descartes has remarked a force is introduced from
some other thing. Wherelore elasticity and gravity
from which spontaneous movements, as they are
usually called, arise, must be supposed to be due to
impact of something invisible. But since such things
as are possessed ol elastic force and gravity are always
ready to move, provided there is nothing to hinder
their motion, it seems that we should certainly con·
clude that there is some kind of matter which being in
constant agitation always strikes the said things in its
motion and tries to move them. It is long since
Descartes drew attention to such perpetually rnoving
matter, and indeed there can bc no doubt whatever
regarding its existence. For I cannot conceive how
sound, and light, and the like, are propagated where
there is no air unless there exists some fine matter by
