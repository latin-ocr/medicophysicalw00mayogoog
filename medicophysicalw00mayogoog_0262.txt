And hence it is that the said cavity is so much
enlarged by incubation. For we must not suppose
that this enlargement of the cavity is produced by
the access of new air, but by the pressure of the air
inside. For although when the blunter end of the
egg is performed, the said cavity is found to be much

larger than in new-laid eggs‚ yet if the sharper end is
broken and the juices of the egg poured out, the
membrana spread over the cavity (which, by the con-
traction ol the juices of the egg and by the elastic
force ol the air, was thrust far into the region of the
eggl will immediately fall back, on account of the
pressure of the external air introduced into the
perforated egg, and be applied anew to the shell; so
that the cavity will nor now appear larger than in
unhatchcd eggs, unless perhaps the air enclosed in it
be still warm and rarefied, in consequence of the
warmth ol the incubating foul-a clear enough proof
that the enlargement of the cavity is due to the
clasticity of the air inside, in virtue of which it
expands into and occupies the space left by the
contraction ol the juices.

Nor yet is it to be supposed that precaution is
taken against a vacuum in the egg, as though nature,
according to the common belief, abhorred a vacuum,
but rather because a vacuum would not be so suitable
lor the generation of the chick. And indeed it is
reasonable to think that the air stored in the egg, in
consequence ol its elastic force (increased not a
little by the fostering warmth of the incubating fowl)
gently compressas the colliquated juices of the egg
and drires thern into the umbilical vessels, and hence
contributes not a little to the commencement of
animal motion.

lt is, moreover, likely that the air inside the egg
