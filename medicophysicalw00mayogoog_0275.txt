On Muscular Motion ancl Animal Spinis 2 39

cause the contractiori of the fibrils is effected. There
can beno doubt that the influx of animal spirits is
necessary for the performance of the motive function,
inasmuch as if a uerve is cut or obstructed, the
muscle to which it is distributed refuses to contraet.
But it is not to be supposed that the contractiori of
the muscles depends on the animal spirits alone, since
for carrying it out there is absolute need of other
particles besides, brought from the mass ol the blood.
For, seeing that the arterial blood is supplied to the
muscles in a continuous flow, and, especially in more
violent movements, in a fuller flow than to other
parts or than is required lor their nutrition, it may be
concluded that the arterial blood in its transit de-
posits something necessary for the contractiori of the
muscles. For, indeed, such is the structure of muscles
that in their contractiori they draw themselves
together, and thus greatly promote the motion of the
blood 3 and that is why the motion of the blood isso '
much accelerated in rapid running. And we can
easily put this to the test, if, when the median vein
hasbeen opened, the muscles attached to the forearm
are contracted (and this can be quite well accomplished

· if the fingers are pressed together in flexion), for when

this is done, the blood will be seen to rush out forcibly,
being pressed out of the said muscles by their contrac-
tion. But this so much accelerated motion of the
blood in contracted muscles does not seem to be
merely incidental, but to be arranged by the highest
wisdom of nature, by which, namely, the motive

particlesnof the blood may be brought in passing to
the motor parts ; and when they have been deposited
from the blood, what remains of it is expelled with a
certain push by the constriction of the shortened
muscle, so that when the loss is repaired, it may again
