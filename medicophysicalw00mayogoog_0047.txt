into a hardish mass with a little water, and let a
small tube, closed at one end, be densely filled with
.it by lorcibly ramming the stuff in with a stick.
Next, let that gunpowder be set 03 fire at the open ’
end 01 the tube, and the tube be inverted and plunged
into water, and kept there. Then the gunpowder will
deflagrate under water until it is all gone. Moreover,
that powder, arranged in the manner aforesaid, will
burn in a glass containing no air, although other fires
are presently extinguished because the aerial lood is
withdrawn—a sufficiently clear prool that sal mirum
contains in itsell the igneo-adrial particles necessary
to the productiori 01 flame; so that 101 its deflagra-
tion there is no need 101 3 supply 01 igneous particles
11031 1113 311.

That igneo-aerial particles exist in nitre is further
evident from this, that flame produced by deflagrating
nitre is caused by the igneo-aerial particles residing in
it and bursting out in a compact body with fiery

’ motion, but not by its sulphureous particles. For it
is probable that nitre has no sulphureous particles as
ingredients; 101 Ι 333301 agree with the famous Dr
Willis, who has stated in his treatise on Fermentation
that there is a great deal 01 sulphur 13 31113. His
principal arguments are these—that 11 nitre is thrown
upon the lire it will immediately produce a flame, and
that it is especially generated in places where there
are sulphureous animal excrements. But, with all
due respect to so eminent a man, I should have
thought that nitre, pure and simple, is in no wise im-
pregnated with sulphureous particles. For neither in
the rectified spirit 01 nitre nor in pure sal alkalz' is
any combustible sulphur to be found ; and yet, from
Α the combination 01 these two, nitre will be produced.
But, because nitre produced in this manner will defla-
