their form be altered by some force 51155 they have
cooled.

But although Ι do not think that the parts of the
rigid body are under tension, still it is probable that
that violence with which the glass drops burst is truly
elastic‚ and that it results as elastic¹ force does from the
impulse ol the subtle matter. And it is probable that
this elastic force arises in the following way. When
the small portion ol glass glows and is in a sense fused,
its structure is opened to such an extent by the rapid
movement ol nitro-adrial and fiery particles, that space
enough exists in it lor the nitro-aerial particles and
besides 1ο5 1155 subtle matter to execute their move·
ments. But when the molten glass is dropped into
cold water the fiery particles crowded at its surlace are
immediately arrested in their motion when they meet
with the water particles, and those in the interior also
soon desist from moving. But it should now be
noticed that when the glass is cooled in this manner
its parts settle down and it becomes itself contracted,
not because these parts ο1 the glass spontaneously
approach each other (for the parts not yet cooled are
not under tension and therefore do not possess a power
of recoil or a motion ol restitution, 55 we have shown
above), but it is rather to be supposed that the sub
sidence ο1 the vitreous parts arises from this, that the
nitro-a'e'rial particles occupy less space when they
cease from their fiery motion and no longer push the
parts ol the glass away from each other, so that the
particles of the glass are forced towards each other by
the pressure ol the atmosphere.

But, now, since the outer surface of the said glass
immediately becomes rigid from being rapidly cooled
by the water, it becomes so solid by reason of the
nitro-aerial particles infixed in it, that the nitro-aerial
