must be bent before it is broken; whence it follows
that the matter contained in the beak undergoes com-
pression anew, as was shown above to happen when
rigid bodies are benr. Hence the subtle matter, com-
pressed by the bending of the beak, strikes against all
the adjoining particles os the glass; but since the
external surlace of the glass is more compact and solid
than its interior parts (for when these globules are
formed, the heated and melted glass is dropped into
cold water, so that the external surface is cooled
quickly by the water while the internal parts cool
more slowly), it comes to pass that the compressed
subtle matter can more easily make a way for itself
into the globular part of the glass, as being less com-
pact, than break through the more solid surface ol the
glass, And this may also be inferred from the fact
that the glass beak can be bent much more and is
broken with greater difficulty than glass under other
conditions. And the reason of this seems to be that
the subtle matter which, when compressed under other
conditions and about to make its escape, bursts through
the particles of the bent glass and drives them out
with violence, now takes its way into the globular part
of the glass (the pyramidal shape ol the glass con·
tributing not a little to this) ε but the particles of the
subtle matter when pushed from the beak into the
globular part ol the gloss, effect a greater compression
there, and in consequence the whole glass is violently
and most minutely fractured. Foras under other
conditions, if glass or any rigid body is broken, the
parts about the middle, where the matter is most
compressed, are broken into small pieces and fly
asunder, so the matter in the glasses here discussed,
being everywhere compressed, bursts all over.
