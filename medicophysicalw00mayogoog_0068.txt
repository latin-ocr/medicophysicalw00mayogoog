On Sal Nitrum and Miro-Aerem Spirit 3¹

in another place that fertile earth is nothing but
sulphur and fixed salt both immature, in astate of
the ctosest combination, and indeed a dark purple
clod of earth appears not very unlike colcothar, except
thatin the latter sulphur is combined with a metallic
salt but in the former with fixed salt. As then the
nitro-aerial spirit effervescing in a fiery motion with
the particles of common sulphur, or again encounter-
ing with more gentle beat the saline-sulphureous
particles of colcothar, sharpens more quickly or more
slowly their saline-metallic particles and brings them
to a fluid condition ; so also the same nitro-aeria] spirit,
descending in virtue of its most penetrating nature
into the depths of the earth, there attacks the ter·
restria] sulphur and fermenting with it in an obscure
motion rubs, attenuates, and sharpens the saline
particles which are firmly clasped in its bosom, so
that they at last became flexile, liquid, and in the
highest degree acrid. The saline particles of the
earth when made fluid in this manner become a
suitable abode in which nitro-aeria} particles may be
hidden and detained. And in my opinion the spirit
of nitre, of the sort obtained by distillation, is com·
posed of these two firmly united.

And so at last 1 have endeavoured to show that
all acid salts are produced from saline particles
brought to a state of fluidity or fusion by means of
, nitro-aerial spirit, and also how this is done. With
respect to the difference of acid liquids-this must be
supposed to result from diversity of the salts out of
which they are formed, as also from this, that
the fixed salts are rubbed and sharpened now in
a greater and now in a less degree by the nitro·
aerial spirit. And yet there is a great affinity and
likeness among aIl acid salts, and in them all, as in
