florid colour, although the blood at the bottom ol the
vessel appears as a dark purpleÍ¾ and yet it too il
exposed to the air will after a short time become
ruddy. So that it is not surprising that the blood in
the lungs, where the air diffused through all its
particles mixes intimately with it, is rendered llorid
throughout.

And now we remark that air mixed with blood
produces the ruddy colour in it, since it sets up
fermentation in its mass. For arterial blood which is

florid has its particles in motion and also effervesces
conspicuously, while the darker and duskier renous
blood is more grumous and is more quickly coagulated
on account ol its feebler effervescence.

The following experiment also corroboratos the

view here taken. Il blood that has been kept for
some time in a vessel be put into a glass from which
the air is exhausted hyan air-pump, the blood at the
surface where it was of a florid colour will effervesce
gentlyand rise in bubbles. But if arterial blood
while still warm be put in a place void ol air, it will
expand in a remarkable way and rise in an almost
infinite number ol bubbles. Audit is probable that
this results partly from the effervescence of its particles
and their being thrown into movement, and partly
from its particles being mixed with air.

But to submit yet another experiment. lf spirit ol
nitre be poured upon a liquid saturated with volatile
salt and sulphur, such as the spirit ol hartshorn
impregnated with its own 0i1,a very marked effer-
vescence and a very ruddy scarlet colour will be pro-
duced at once in the liquid, and yet this florid colour
changes into a dark purple when the liquid ceases to
effervesce. No doubt the nitro-aerial particles (aml
we have elsewhere shown that the spirit ol nitre
