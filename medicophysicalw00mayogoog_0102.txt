On Sal Nitrum and Narro-Almo! Spirt't 65

particles and the subtle matter existing in the interior
cannot as in other cases extricate themselves. Hence
it is that in glass contracted in this way the subtle
matter imprisoned among the minutest particles ol
the glass has not room as before for freely continuing
its movements. For resistance is made to the move-
rnent of the subtle matter, from two causes; first,
because the particles of the glass being at rest do not
yield to the movement ol the subtle matter as before ;
and secondly, because the particles of the glass in sub-
siding under the pressure of the atmosphere are driven
into the little spaces in which the perpetually agitated
matter carries out its motion. Hence that matter
strikes the particles ol glass which oppose its motion
and endeavours to part thern from each other. lndeed
the case is very much as if the glass were bent almost
to breaking; in fact it is to be observed that the
pulsation of the subtle matter is almost capable os
breaking the said glasses, as is evident from the lact
that when drops ol molten glass are dropped into
water most of them immediately burst asunder 3 and
indeed we must suppose that all the rest just escape
being broken.

Wherefore when the beak of this kind of glass is
broken, the force ol the subtle matter, aided somewhat
hythe concussion of the whole glass caused by the
fracture of the beak, is now able to draw the particles
os the glass apart and to thrust them out with violence.
l add further that when the glass is broken in any
part, the particles ol glass which were previously con-
fined by its extremely solid surlace, rush out by the
open door at the very moment when the effort ol the
subtle matter begins to take effect, and by this no
small addition is made to its force. And, finally, let ns
further consider that the pointed beak of the glass
