muscular substance, not otherwise than in other
muscles.

Wherefore on the suppression of respiration, as
that aerial salt required for any motion fails, the
beating ol the heart and, consequently, the flow of
blood to the brain will necessarily be interrupted and
death will ensue. But one may live for a certain
time without breathing, because the blood contained
in the pulmonary vessels and sufficiently impregnated
with airis capable of moving the heart at least for a
moment.

And this use of respiration can be further confirmed.
For in exercises and violent movements there is need
of more intense and more frequent respiration, not so
much that a greater flow of blood rnay pass freely
through the lungs-for we have shown that this can
take place when respiration stops—but because there
isa great expenditure of nitro-aerial salt in conse·
quence of the various effervescences made in the
contractiori of the muscles; so that the venous blood
returns to the heart now much impoverished and
thick (and we know that this also happens after
convulsive movements in epilepsy). Wherefore, that
the effete blood may repair the waste, there is of all
things need of more intense respiration. Resides, an
acceleration ol the heart's beat is necessary in violent
movements on account ol the more copious flow of
blood; but this can scarcely be effected without freer ·
’ supply of nitro-aerial particles-especially since the
blood is now effete. So that a main use ol respiration
clearly appears to be to set up the motion of the
muscles and especially of the heart. Hence the frog
which is accustomed to live under water lor some
time without respiration will go on living, even when
its heart is cut out; but to animals which require a
