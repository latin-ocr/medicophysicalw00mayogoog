distribution of nitro-aerial spirits, and the other for
the diffusion of the blood, and besides for the reception
of nitro-aerial. particles. If the obstruction takes
place in the former, the mass of the blood will lack
its due ferment, the influx of fermentative spirits being
shut off from the spleen3 but if the latter are ob-
structed, the saline-sulphureous particles of the blood
detained too long in the parenchyma of the spleen
and too much fermented, will acquire an acid and
dried up, or what is the same thing, an atrabilous
character.

2. lf the substance of the spleen is corroded by an
ulcer, or in any other way broken, the nitro-a'e‘rial
particles will not now as at other times be mixed in
its parenchyma intimately and uniformly with the
mass of the blood, but in a too crowded and confused
way, whence a too intense effervescence is set up, on
account of which the saline-sulphureous particles of
the blood become much dried up and sooty.

Fronr what has been said, it is not difficult to
understand how it is that an animal can live when
deprived of so notable an organ as the spleen; for
although the offices here assigned to the spleen
conduce in no small degree to the correct carrying on
of the animal economy and to perfect health, still
they are not so necessary but that life can be kept up
in a so-so way without them.

We may here note, by the way, that the parts of
all sorts of animals contain an ample quantity of
volatile salt, but scarcely any fixed salt, as is shown
by their distillation and combustion; and yet many
animals live on vegetables only, and in these there is
little or uo volatile salt to be found, but much fixed or
rather nitrous salt: so that it would plainly seem
that the fixed or nitrous salts of the food are trans·
