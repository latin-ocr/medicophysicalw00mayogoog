and repeat it two or three times at intervals ol about
seven days. Although practical men make much of
this kind oi scarification, I do not know whether
leeches would not do as well, or even better. For
1 do not think that the leeches by their sucking
would cause any increased flow of blood to the head.
For whatever blood comes by their suction to the
part to which they are applied is removed by the
suction itself ; and as to the increased flow ot blood
caused by the depletion ot the blood-vessels, that
occurs in venesection as well.

Further, in this disorder issues are of special use,
particularly an issue between the first and second
cervical vertebrae, for in that position, close to the
origin ol the disease, it has the greater efficacy.
And the usefulness of issues consists in this, that they
largely contribute to the evacuation of the super-
fluous serosity oi the hrain, and so to the diminution
of its abnormal siae, and also to the drying up oi the
excessive humidity of the spinal marrow, and conse-
quently to the strengthening ol the nerves thence
arising. A seton can supply the place of an issue.

As to blisters, there can beno doubt that, placed
over the vertebrae of the neck or behind the ears,
they will bring relief3 but their action is suddenly
put forth, and their frequent use seems to be too
troublesome and painful to the children.

Further, ‘cupping without scarification, applied

along the spine, seems to be of no small importance
for correcting the humid and frigid condition of the
spinal marrow and for removing the torpor of the
nerves. Indeed, Ι think cupping, even with slight
scarification, should sometimes be used close to the
upper cervical vertebrae.
