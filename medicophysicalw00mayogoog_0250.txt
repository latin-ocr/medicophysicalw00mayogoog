The celebrated Harvey has maintained that the use
ol the umbilical arteries is to supply arterial blood lor
the concoction and colliquation ol the food of the
foetus, and to render it suitable for nutrition ; but it is
scarcely probable that the umbilical arteries should be
designed for this purpose exclusively, since nutritious
juice could be well enough concocted and elaborated
by the mother's heat and the warmth of the uterus.
And it certainly seems foreign to the method of
Nature that blood should be poured 011 food for its
concocti0n‚ as if into a dish. For why should not
nutritious juice be prepared within the body of the
embryo as well in the uterus as alter birth?
Certainly there is no reason why that should hedone
through winding paths and the long circuit ol the
umbilical arteries‚ which could be managed by a
shorter route and with less trouble. And it also
makes lor this that it is probable that the offshoots ol
the umbilical vessels are distributed into nrembranes‚
but not into juices to colliquate them, as seems to be
confirmed by the very examination of a hatched egg.
And certainly il the openings ol the umbilical arteries
terminated in the primogenial juices the said juices
would soon be drenched with arterial blood ; but this
is not the case. Further‚ we may believe that capillary
vessels ol whatever kind, never end in juices but
always in membraneS‚ for otherwise they would be
less firm and their openings would be closed by the
pressure ol the juices on all sides. indeed, just as the
lacteal vessels which originate in the intestinal
membraues receive the nutritious juice, passed
through these membranes as if through a filter‚ and
convey it into the mass of the blood, so also in an egg
and in other objects of conception we must suppose
that nutritious juice, properly concocted, enters the
