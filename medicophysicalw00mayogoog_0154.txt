glass, as was shown above; then let another small

portion of the air produced as before be conveyed in
like manner to the glass‚ and let this process be repeated
until the air is present in sufficient quantity.

And that we may now make our experiment, let a
small animal, say a mouse placed in a small cage, be
placed in the upper part of the cavity of an inverted glass
with asuitable support below it, as is delineated in Plate
V., F ig. 6. And let the glass with the animal inside be
so immersed in thewater, that the water inside nray
rise as high as the support on which the mouse rests,
which can be done by means of the curved syphon de·
scribed in Chapter VH. ; and let everything remain in
this condition till the animal dies, and let the length
of time during which the animal breathes in the glass
be carefuily noted. Now let the dead animai be re·
moved and another living animal be put in its place.
And let it as before be shut in the glass immersed in
the water, care being taken that the same quantity of
air as before may be enclosed in the glass. This done,
let the aforesaid air be transferred, as described, into
the glass containing the animal, in such quantity that
the air thus introduced shall by two or even three times
exceed the quantity of ordinary air enclosed from the
first in the glass. And then let the glass be raised till
the water (which is depressed by the air introduced)
reaches the support on which the animal restS, care
being taken that the mouth of the glass be not lifted
above the water. And let everything continue thus
till the animal dies. When this has occurred we shall
find that the animal has not lived much longer in the
glass on the second occasion than the other did on the
first ; that is to say, before the aforesaid air was intro-
duced into the giass. But if that air were truly
air suitable for sustaining life, the animal put in on
