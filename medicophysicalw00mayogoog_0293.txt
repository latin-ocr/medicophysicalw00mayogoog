On Muscular Motion and Animal szit'ts 257

can, at their own will, give a luminous motion to the
nitro-aerial spirits in the eye, Ι cannot certainly

decide: it is so far an indication of this that the cat
can use its sense of vision even in the dark.

It isin harmony with the hypothesis stated above
that animals struck by lightning are not unfrequently
killed without any injury, or vestige of a blow. But
that the reason of this may be understood,l may
repeat here what l have elsewhere endeavoured to
show, via, that lightning is caused by the nitro-aetial
particles diffused through the whole atmosphere being
thrown by the violent concussion of the air into a
luminous, and sometimes really igneous motion.
Wherefore‚ if nitro-aerial particles constitute the
animal spirits, it may sometimes happen that they
in the brain follow the motion oi the nitro-aerial
particles forming the lightning in the air ; so that
the animal spirits would seem not so much struck
by lightning as themselves to form lightning. And
hence it is that they, being violently moved and as it
were set on fite, are dissipated in a moment; and so
on account of the flame kindled in its brain the
animal, deprived of the common light and breath,
is extinguished. But this will be dealt with later.

We may note here in passing that animals have
need ol more intense respiration for some time alter
violent exercise. The reason of this seems to be that
the blood returned from the brain to the heart is to a
great extent deprived of nitro-aerial particles, inas·
much as it had deposited some in the brain and in
the cerebellum to supply animal spirits; whence it
comes about that no small part of the blood goes
without its proper fermentation, because ol the lack
of nitro-aerial particles, and is to some small extent
coagulated. For it hasbeen elsewhere shown that
