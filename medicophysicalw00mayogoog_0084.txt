in order to produce in substances the more sluggish
movement of fermentation, so, on the other hand,
for an effervescence exceedingly intense and igneous‚
it appears to be necessary that nitro-aerial spirit
should exist in a somewhat fixed condition, but the
sulphureous pairticles in a state of vigour and
motion, as we have indicated above.

OF NITRO-AFRIAL SPIRIT IN SO FAR AS IT PRO-
DUCES RJGlDlTr' IN BODIES', AND THE POWER
OF RESILIENCE. ALSO OF THE CA USE OF ELAS-
TICITY. INCIDENTALLY OF THE BREAKING OF
GLASS DROFS

THUs far we have treated of nitro-aeria] spirit in its
state of motion and vigour; it remains to contemplate
it in a state of rest. As the nitro-aerial particles in
astate of motion are the cause os nearly all natural
movements-so‚ on the other hand, they are the
cause, 1 think, of rigidity and the power of resil-
ience, when quiescent and securely fixed in the pores
of bodies.

For in order that glass or iron and the like may
become rigid and acquire the power of resilience
they must be made to glow in a very hot fire, and
then be quickly cooled by being plungcd at once
into cold water, that so the nitro-adrial particles
conveyed by the fire to the said substances may
be obstructed in their movement by encountering
cold, and secured more firmly in the structure of
these substances· For the same nitro-aerial par-
