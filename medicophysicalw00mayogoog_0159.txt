and there impinging upon the subtle matter agitated
with extreme velocity, are, by its impulse, thrust out
with elastic violence along with the nitro-aerial par·
ticles which these substances contain3 so the milder
fermentation of natural things must be, supposed to
arise from this, that nitro-aerial particles‚ along with ex-
traneous moisture, penetrate a saline-sulphureous mass
and enter the abode ol the subtle matter, by which, as
it is in violent agitation‚ the nitro-aerial together with
the sulphureous particles are driven off. For fiery
effervescence seems to differ only in this respect
from the milder internal motions by which plants
hasten to growth or decay, that in fire, nitro-aerial
particles, in close union with fixed salt or with aerial
particles, are, by the impulse of sulphureous particles
and of the subtle matter, violently sundered from their
partner and thrown into very brisk motion ; whereas,
on the other hand, in the said fermentations‚ as the
sulphureous particles are not held so firmly in the
embrace of fixed salt, they are thrown into a milder
motion by the impact of the nitro-aerial particles and
of the subtle matter. But these matters have been
more fully discussed elsewhere. Nor does the process
seem to be different in the effervescence of opposed
liquids, for when one of these intrudes into the pores
of another, and therefore also into the abode of the
subtle matter, and is expelled again‚an internal move·
ment and effervescence of the particles is set up.·

WHl' THE FORM OF FLAME IS AtWA l'S
POINTED

As to lire, let us consider lastly why fiame of every
sort rises to a point. On this it is to be remarked‚
in the first place, that the sulphureous particles, burst·
ing out from the burning matter, pass through the
