On Sal Nitrum and Miro-Adrial spirit 15

great hindrance to fire, since it is exceedingly well
adaptedforextinguishingfieryparticles. But although
the spirit ol nitre will not deflagrate if put into a
flame, yet if it is poured upon salt ol tartar‚ nitre will
be generated from the combination, and il this be
thrown into the fire it will immediately produce flame.
But we must suppose that the flame of this deflagrat·
ing nitre is caused by the igneo-aerial particles ol the
nitrous spirit being thrown into agitation. For the
salt of tartar of which the rest of the nitre is corn·
posed seems to be very alien to the nature of flame,
as we have shown above. But the reason why the
igneo-adrial particles os nitrous spirit are well adapted,
when combined with fixed salt, for producing flame,
seems to be this, that when the spirit of nitre unites
with fixed salt to form nitre, its humidity being lost,
it changes into a dry and rigid substance3 so that as
its igneo-aerial particles exist now in a dry condition,
there is no obstacle to their commencing a fiery
motion.

Further, nitro-aerini particles must, it appears, il
they are to take the form of flame‚ enter into close
combination with a fixed salt, or with something else
to take the place of the fixed salt 3 so that they may
be torn violently and with elastic force from their
partner and thrown into a state of the most rapid
motion, as I shall endeavour to show below.
