SECOND TREATISE

ow ussrtwu‘rrou

m sung» are placed in a recens so sacred and hidden
that nature would seem to have specially withdrawn
this part both from the eyes and from the intellect;
for, beyond the wiell, it hes not as yet been granted
to any one to fit awindow to the breast and redeem

from darkness the proluunder secrets of nature. For
ol all the parts ol the body, the lungs alone, as if
shrlnking from observation‚ cease from their move·
nt and collapso at once on the first entrance ot
light and aelf-revelation. Hence such an ignorance of
Respitation anda sort ol holy wonder. Sti11‚1et me
draw near to the inmost vitals‚ and, concerning so
obscure a matter, make at least a guess.

’ In discussing on Respiration I shall follow the
method pointed out by nature and begin therefore
with inspiration.

Every one knows that when we inspire‚ air rushes
into the expanded chest and inflates the lungs. But
authorities are not equally agreed as to the cause ol
the air rushing in with such vehemence. Some
account for it by a vacuum and an attraction ofI

know ngt what imaginary sort.
