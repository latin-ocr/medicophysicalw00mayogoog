On Sal lllitrum and ll'itru-Adn'al Spirit 181

⁷ penetrated in some places by pores of a kind
suitable for the passage in dense numbers ol aerial
particles, and lor sucking thern in, as it were. For
since the aerial particles, carried to the saline-sul-
phureous mineral and effervescing with it, are swept
away by the streams of water flowing thence, the
result is that the nearest particles of air are forced by
atmuspheric pressure into the place ol those carried
away, while these also are soon absorbed and followed
by others, and thus aerial particles come to the
effervescing mineral in a continual stream.

Perhaps the lofty hills, with deep and abrupt ¹
valleys between, which engirdle Bath on all sides,

, contribute sonrewhat to the entrance of aerial particles

into the ground and to the rnaintenance ol the heat
ol the thermal waters. For, in consequence of this,
the air thrown back lrorn the hills, and reflected in
various directions in the valleyS, strikes forcibly
against the ground and is thrust into it.

It is a further proof ol the views set forth, that the
Bath waters contain a saline-sulphureous mineral,
which seerns not very unlike those marchasites from
which vitriol is made; and indeed the sand ol the baths,
it exposed for some tirne to the air, will effervesce and
turn into vitriol. But the reason that the salts ol the
said therrnal waters are ol an acido-saline nature
seems to be, that when the saline-sulphureous mineral
effervesces in the manner already described, some ol
the saline particles are brought to a certain fluidity‚
as was previously remarked. But these saltS, when
thus liquefied, unite with the other salts which areos
an alkaline nature, and from these, cornbined with
one another, a certain acido-saline salt is conrposed. It
is, however, only an immature salt, since it is swept
away, while not yet duly fermented nor brought to
