seems to be nothing else than an affusion of blood,
which, when coagulated, adheres to these vesicles,
for, while the mass of the blood wanders like the
Maeander among these channels and glides past them
in its placid stream, the thicker particles are deposited
on account of the slackness of the motion, and adhere
to the sides of the vesicles, and yet, if the blood
circulare more quickly, they are carried away with its
'impetuous rush, and hence it is that in the heat of
lever and in the more violent exercises, the muscular
parts are despoiled and become lean.

As to the use of the fieshy parenchyma‚ it is
probable that the aforesaid vesicles, along with the
sanguineous sediment adjoined to them, act as a filter,
by which the motive particles are separated from the
massot the blood, as we have indicated above. And
it tells in favour of this, that the parenchyma of the
fiesh turgid with blood is compressed by 'the constric-
tion ol the contracted muscle and by the natural subsid-
’ enceof the parts ; whence it comes about that the motive
particles are driven, as it were, bya powerful squeeze
into the motor parts to carry on the function of motion.

As to the nature of the motive particles separated
from the mass of the blood, it is our opinion that they
are ol a saline-sulphureous quality. Ι think, namely,
that sulphureous and saline particles brought to the
highest volatility in the mass of the blood by its
continuous fermentation in the manner elsewhere
described, and most intimately joined together, are
separated from the blood by the action ol the
muscular parenchyma and stored up in the motor

parts for setting up their contractiori. For we may
note that uo small loss of fat takes place in the
more violent exercises, and that it almost wholly
disappears in long-continued hard work; while yet,
