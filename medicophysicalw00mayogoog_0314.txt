salts of vegetables, why should we not suppose that
that very intense working of nitro-aerial and
sulphureous particles excited in the spleen should

suffice to volatilise the fixed, or rather the nitrous, ¹

salts of the chyle? It tends in this direction also
that the saline-sulphureous particles in the spleen
become somewhat burnt and sooty, as we have
indicated above. We might here also show that
fermentations of all kinds excited in the bodies of
animals corne from the working of nitro-aerial and
saline-sulphureous particleS, if this were not foreign
to our present subject.

OF THE DISEASES WHICH ΗΑ VE TO DO lVlTH
ANIMAL SPIRITS

From the hypothesis as to the nature ol animal
spirits stated above, we can at once say in what the
animal economy consists, and also can give an explana-
tion of many diseases which have to do with the
motive function.

For properly keeping up the animal lile, it is first
of all necessary that the lungs should be in a healthy
condition, so that the nitro-aerial particles may be
transmitted in sufficient abundance into the mass ol
the blood and intimately mixed with its sulphureous
particles. Hence, if the lungs are corrupted or even
wasting and flaccid, the mass ol the blood will not be
properly fermented, on account of the deficiency oi
nitro-aerial particles: and so, as the motive particles
of both kinds would be deficient, there would follow
extreme lowering of the powers, and weakness, and
consumption of the body.

Further, in order that the animal function should

be properly carried on, it is necessary that the nitro-
