On Mascular Motion and Animal Spirits 2 59

that would come from without. Why, then, should
the animal spirits not rather be derived from air than
from food taken iu? Undoubtedly the air is im·
pregnated with most active and subtle particles; and
there is such a necessity of inhaling it that not for a
moment can we live without it. And indeed it does
not seem possible that the immense expenditure of
animal spirits can be supplied from any other source
but the air.

But as to the artifice of the animal mechanism,
it consists in this, that the parts of the body are
formed with such perfect adjustment that quite
stupendous effects are produced in it by common
causes.

Ι may note here, by the way, that while Ι hold that
nitro-a'e'rial particles are the animal spirits, I do not
wish to be so understood as if Ι thought nitro-aerial
spirit to be the sensitive soul itself: for we must
suppose that the sensitive soul is something quite
different from animal spirits, and that it consists of a
special subtle and ethereal matter, but that the nitro-
aerial particleS, aa, the animal spirits, are its chief
instrument. For, indeed, as to the sensitive soul, I
can form no other notion about it than that it is some
more divine arira, endowed with sense from the first
creation and co-extensive with the whole world, and
that a little portion of it, contained in a properly
disposed subject, exercises functions of the kind which
we observe and admire in the bodies of animals; but
that that spiritual material, existing out of the bodies
of living things, is not to be supposed either to
perceive or to do anything but to lie quite dormant
and inert‚ being much as is the case with the sensitive
soul when the animal is buried in sleep.

The afflux of arterial blood does not seem sufficient
