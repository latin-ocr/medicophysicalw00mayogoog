they should contract and swell up so much, inas-
much as their series are, as is shown in the figure
referred to, arranged according to the length of the
muscle‚ so that the contractiori of the muscle will be
equal to that of the fibrils. But now, as nature is in
the habit of taking the shortest road, it is probable
that the contractiori of the muscle is produced by the
contractiori of the fibrils rather than by that of the
. libres. And it also tells in favour of this, that, as the
iibrils are very small and very short, their contractiori
even to a half would scarcely be anything remarkable ;
for as the fibrils suffer contraction as a whole, the case
is just as if fibres stretched according to the length of
the muscle were forced into manifold corrugations‚
and their contractiori, taking place thus, although it
be pretty great, can yet occur without notable swell-
ing of the muscle.

To thesei further add that the shortened fibriis
draw the fieshy fibres together and constrict them : so
that it is probable that the contractiori of the muscles
is accomplished by the fibrils; inasmuch as amuscle
when contracted is conspicuously constricted and
becomes hard; and it does not seem that this could
take place in any other way than hythe contractiori
of the fibrils. But there will bea fuller discussion of
the constriction of the contracted muscle later.

Moreover‚ it is nature’s custom very often to carry
on her operations by means of very small things, so
that the fibres seem too thick and coarse for nruscular
contractiori to take place prinrarily in them; and it is
probable that they serve rather for transmitting blood
than for carrying on animal motion, as will be shown
below.

Lastly‚ it tells in favour of this, that the shortness
of the fibrils and their almost infinite number con·
