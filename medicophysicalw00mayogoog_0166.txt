from the centre of the vortex to its outer edge, but .
where the air is rarer the aqueous particles can more
easily continue their movements; and, turned back
in this way, they arrive at last at the middle of the
aerial vortex (which behaves like a vacuous tube), and,
congregated densely there, are carried aloft in a
swift whirl and spiral revolution, as is shown in the
figure. Moreover the spiral motion of those vapours
arises from the circular motion of the surrounding air.

To bring the said vapours to the middle of the aeria}
vortex, and thence to raise them on high, the pressure
of the atmosphere seems to contribute not a little, in
addition to the force by which they have been torn
from the mass of water. For since the air at the
summit of the atmosphere is much rarer than that
which is nearer the earth, and its pressure less, and
since, also, the aerial vortex rotates there more rapidly
(for the force which constrains the air to rotate prob-
ably comes from above), it follows that the force by
which the aerial particles strive to recede from the
centre of their motion will take effect much more
easily at the summit ol the atmosphere than near the
underlying water; so that high up in the air where,
namely, the said tube is seen, the aerial particles

recede from the centre os the vortex and are able to '

produce a vacuum there, whereas the air from the
lower end of the tube to the underlying water, being
rotated less rapidly, is merely able to diminish the
pressure of the atmosphere, which is greater there.
but not altogether to remove it; and hence, the air
and vapours at e, e (where the vacuous tube begins),
are driven sorcibly into the tube by the pressure ol
the surrounding air. F urther, as all the neighbour-
ing particles of air and vapours corne into the place
of those that have been carried up, and others again
