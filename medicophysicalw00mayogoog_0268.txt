would be required for its contractiora, if that were
brought about by the inflation of its libres, as has
already been noted some tirne ago by Lower. But
that in some contracted muscles we seem to feel a
tumour, does not, 1 think, corne so much from their
swelling as from the movement ol the belly of the
muscle, in its contraction, towards the fixed tendon,
so that the ascent of the belly of the muscle caused in
this way, raises a hand placed on the muscle and
simulates a tumour.

Further‚ ir some elastic matter contained within
the passages of the fibres inflated thern in the way
described, how could it be that the fibres should in a
moment subside again, as happens in the glance of
the eye and in other instantaneous contractions of the
libres? For neither can Ι comprehend how that
elastic matter should in an instant inflate the fibres
and again extricate itself from their passages, for if an
easy way out of the libres lay open to that rarefied
matter, it would pass quickly through the fibres and
not properly inflate them.

Moreover, it is hardly likely that the animal spirits,
in the relaxation of the muscle, return from the fleshy
into the tendinous libres, for it is not easy to conceive
what should regulate these spirits in their movement
of retreat. Besides as, according to the opinion ol
the learned author, the animal spirits springing forth
< into the fibres meet there particles of another kind
collected in sufficient abundance, and at once, as a
whole, mutually effervesce with them, it would seem
that these spirits would either be wholly dissipated, or
be changed into something else quite different from
what they were before3 so that they would become
altogether unfit for again exciting effervescence.

Finally, as to the part of the rnuscle which primarily
