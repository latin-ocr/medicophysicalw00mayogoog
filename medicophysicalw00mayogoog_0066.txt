On Sal Mirum and Moru-Atinas Spm't 29

But indeed iron rust also, which has avitriolic
nature, seems to be produced by the action of
nitro-aerial particles meeting with the metallic
sulphur of iron, for the saline particles of the
iron when brought into a fluid condition in the
manner aforesaid corrode and dissolve its metallic
particles, and from these combined, rust or a sort
of imperfect -vitriol is produced-very much as if
the iron had been smeared with some aeid liquid.

It should also be noticed that acid salt or sourness
is produced by the action of nitro-aerial spirit not
only in solids but also in liquids. For it is not
enough to say that the acidification or the fluidity
of the salts arises from this, that saline particles which
before had been mutually hidden by the intervention
of the other particles, afterwards, the bond of the
mixture being loosed‚ flow together and spread
themselves out through the whole structure of the
substance, and that when these gain dominion
sourness is produced in the mixture as some have
imagined. For we must suppose that all the salts
of the liquid were even from the first diffused
through its whole mass, since they were dissolved in
the liquid. It should rather be maintained that
· the souring of liquids is caused by the change of ⁸
their fixed salt into an aeid salt, a result which
is probably due to the action of nitro-aerial spirit.
For liquids abounding in fixed salt and sulphur, such
as French wine and strong ale, acquire acidity
from lengthy fermentation. Moreover, the fermenta-
tion of the liquids consists in the effervescence of
nitro-aerial particles, whether contained in the liquid
or entering from without, with the saline-sulphureous
particles of the liquid, as I shall endeavour to show
below. And hence it is that the saline particles of
