148 Mayow

there would be no second flash. And indeed the
llash would continue for some time 3 but the opposite
is the case.

Should any one here say that the sulphureous ex-
halations, which are imprisoned here and there among·
the clouds, are separately kindled in consequence
ol their being violently agitated, and that the flash of
lightning is due to the wide expansion of their light y
Ι reply that it is scarcely prohable that a fire so im-
mense as to be capable of propagating light to such
vast distanceS, is produced by a succession ol separate
flashes‚ lor it is to be noted that lightning is not
only seen at a distance, but reaches to the eye of the
spectator. Further, if lightning were nothing else
than rays of light, how does it happen that it not in-
frequently sets lire to things which it meets? For this
is never done, even by the solar rays, except when
collected by a hurning-glass. And from what source
finally should the power come, which is required for
the effects usually produced by lightning, if it consisted
merely of light?

Iconfess for my part that sulphureous exhalations
disseminated through the air are not infrequently
kindled by lightning, but the llame produced by their
burning is quite different from a flash ol lightning,
and is propagated hither and thither in a skirmishing
way, as it is led by the exhalations, and it also lasts
lor some time. Such a llame is sometimes seen ina
very intense flash.

But that it may be understood what I think about
lightning, it is allowable lorus to assume that thunder·
storrns are caused by this, that the clouds high up
in the atmosphere, when condensed and lrozen, descend
on those beneath with a violent crash, as has been
shown by the very ingenious Descartes Further,
