spirit, as has been shown elsewhere.

F urther‚ in all the interna] movements which take
place in the bodies ο1 animals, as in the digestion ο1

gives rise to muscular contraction‚ nitro-aerial particles
*play the chief part, as I shall attempt to show in the
fourth treatise.

CHAPTER IX

WHETHER AIR CAN BE GENERA TED ANB W

Now that we have shown above in how many ways
airis impaired, it will not be out of place to inquire
whether it can be generated anew. On this pointI
shall introduce an experiment not very unlike the
one by the illustrious Boyle already referred to.
Let, then, spirit of nitre and spring water, mixed in
equa] quantities‚ be placed ina glass vessel ο1 sufficient
size. Then let a small glass be 5ο placed under the
mixture that it shall be completely filled with the
liquid. This done, let two or three globules ο1 iron
be placed at the mouth of this glass, and let it lie
vinverted at the bottom os the other, as is shown in
Plate V., Fig. 3, care being taken that these globules
do not fall out ο1 the gloss, and to secure this let the

· mouth of this glass be closed with the finger or in any

other way, until it rests at the bottom ο1 the other

glass. These preparations made, the aeid menstruum
will, after a short time, corrode the iron globules and
effervesce conspicuously with them, and the exhala-
