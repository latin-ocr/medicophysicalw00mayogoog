whole blaze and kindle flame everywhere in their
passage. For since the sulphureous particles, which
burn at the top of a lamp, have proceeded from the
wick, they must necessarily have passed through the
whole ol the intermediate flame. Further‚ it is not to
be doubted that these particles were burning from their
first entrance into the fleme, since the lowest partos
the flame is produced only by the kindling of sul-
phureous particles. And hence it is that when a lamp
,goes out in consequence ol a failure ol sulphureous
nutriment‚ the flame is last seen at the top and at
some distance from the wick. For it is the last group
-oisulphureous particles passing through the blaze, and
everywhere in its transit kindling fleme, that is seen at
the top ol the blaze. But since no sulphureous par·
ticles now remain to follow these last ones, there must
be an interval without flame between the last burning
particles at the top ol the flame and the wick.

But now the question arises why the sulphureous
particles at a certain distance from the wick no longer
kindle flame. For since the sulphureous particles burn
at the extreme verge ol the flame, they must conse·
quently be in more violent motion there than when,
as yet unkindled, they were about to enter the flnme.
And therefore there seems to be more reason for these
particles, once kindled‚ persevering in their fiery
movement and flame, than for their entering upon a
fiery movement at first. As to this, my opinion is
that the fire is extinguished at a certain distance
from the wick, not because the motion 0l the sul-
phureous particles is diminished‚ but because, in their
passage through the fiame, they are rubbed so much
vaud made so small and subtle by their own combus-
tion that they become at last incapable of throwing
nitro-aerini particles into fiery movement. ln lact,
