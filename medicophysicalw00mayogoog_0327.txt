it. Indeed, if tbe finger be held at some distance from
the left ventricle, when the heart contraets the side
ol that ventricle will be briskly dashed against the
finger. And that this is really the case has already
been remarked by the eminent men, our own
Harvey and Lower.

Harvey beld that this kind ol pulsation of the
beart arises thus: that while the walls of the
ventricles contract as to length, they must increase in
thickness, just as when other muscles contract they
swell up, becoming broader. l admit that the walls of
the ventricles of the beart do in contractiori become
somewhat thicker, but it is scarcely credible tbat they
swell up sufficiently to account for the pulsation
against the chest; for it hasbeen made out that
muscles do notin their contraction swell up so much
as is commonly believed.

Ithink, then, that we should hold as to the pulsation
of tbe beart, that the fibres ol the beart, in their
contractiori, draw its cone towards its base as to the
more fixed end; whence it comes about that the

walls of the ventricles are carried outwards, tbe
pressure of the contained blood contributing to this.
To this it may at once he objected‚ with Harvey.
that a curved fibre in contracting becomes straighter
and is not distended in a circle, aud so as the walls
of the ventricles of the beart are in a circular position
tbey will he carried inwards towards a straight line,
and not outwards lreply, if botb ends ol the curved
fibre were fixed, it would, when shortened, be brought
towards a straight position ; but if one ol the ends of
tbe fibre be movable, and even is in fact moved,
it can, in its contractiori, be distended circularly: lor,
in Plate 111, Fig. 9, let a, i, b, be a curved libre, or the
internal wall of tbe left ventricle of the heart, and a, e,
