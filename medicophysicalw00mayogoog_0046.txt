On Sal Mirum and Nitro-Ae‘rz'al spirit 9

lood. For since there is more room 101 receiving the
smoke in the empty glass than in the glass that is 1011
01 315, the lamp would go out in the latter sooner than
in the former, 11 115 extinction were due to tbe smoke.
Besides, no sulphureous matter, 11 placed in a glass
150111 which the air has been pumped‚ can be kindled
either by ignited charcoal or 11011, 01 by the solar rays
collected by means 01 3 burning-glass; so that there
can beno doubt whatever that certain 351131 particles
are quite indispensable 10 the productiori 01 fire, and,
indeed, it is our opinion that these are mainly instru-
mental in the production 01 fire, and that the shape
of the flame is mainly dependent upon these,
thrown into extremely brisk motion, as will be ex· .
plained at greater length below. But it is not to he
supposed that the air 115511, but only that its more
active and subtle part is the igneo-aerial food, since a
lamp enclosed in a glass goes out when there is still
an ample enough supply 01 315 111 11, 101 neither is it
to be believed that the particles 01 315 which existed
in the said glass are annihilated by the burning 01 1115
lamp, nor yet that they are dissipated, since they are
unable to penetrate the glass Further, it is impos-
sible that these igneo-aerial particles 315 any perfect
nitre, as is generally supposed—for it was already
pointed out that not the very nitre as a whole, but
only a certain part 01 11, resides in the air.

In the second place, it would be reasonable to suppose
that the igneous particles 01311 necessary to the support
of all flame reside in sal mirum and constitute its more
active and fiery part, 101 11 15 10 be noted that 111115
mixed with sulphur deflagrates readily enough in a ¹
glass which does 1101 50111311] 311, and also under water,
as will be established by the following experiment;
