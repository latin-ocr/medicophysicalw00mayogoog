will not be transmitted to the brain for the prepara·
tion of animal spirits, and therefore the animal will
speedily die.

From these things I conclude that it is to some
extent made out that nitro-a'e'rial particles, transmitted
by means of respiration to the mass of the blood and
thence to the brain, are the animal spirits themselves.

And this is in accordance with the fact that animals ’
placed in a glass vessel from which the air is exhausted
by means of Boyle's air-pump, after a short time
perish miserably in convulsions. For the animal
spirits being deprived, by the removal of the air, of
their due supplement, enter, as is their wont, upon
disorderly movements, and rushing tumultuously into
the nervous system, excite convulsive movements,
and at last the animal dies for want of air and of
spirits.

To these things I further add that those who suffer
from English consumption are very much weakened
aud are almost destitute of animal spirits. And the
reason of this seems to be, that as their lungs are
wasting and flaccid, the nitro-aerial spirit is no longer
brought to the mass of the blood in quantity sufficient
for the preparation of animal spirits.

Nor should it be overlooked that in pestilential
diseases the brain chiefly suffers, and the economy
of the animal spirits is disturbed: for in so far aS, in
the spread of the plague, the nitro-aerial spirit is
tainted by the poison, it must follow that the animal
spiritS, composed of it, are out of sorts.

At any rate nitro-aerial particles seem to be in the
highest degree suitable for the preparation of animal
spirits; for it is the nature of spirits to be sometimes
inert and languid, and indeed on the other hand
sometimes very active and agile. Similarly the nitro-
