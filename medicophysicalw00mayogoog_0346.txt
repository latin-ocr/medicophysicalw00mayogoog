strumous swellings, is now lor the most part diverted
into the spinal marrow, so that the strumae deprived
of nutriment‚ soon dry up.

¹4. The bones are always more or less bent in this
disease, particularly the bones ol the leg and of the fore·
arm. The joints also are often inclined outwards ; the
extremities of the ribs‚ where they join with the carti-
lages ol the sternum, are nodose; the bones of the
joints are protuberant; also the whole spine is bent
variously, here outward, here inward. 1 do not think
that this curvature of the bones is¹ owing to their flexi-
bility, because the children afflicted with this disease
have rather larger and firmer bones than others, as will
later be shown at some length ς yet as this curvature ol
the bones is very notahle‚ I may be allowed to discuss it
somewhat more fully, and I shall first give the learned
Dr Glisson’s opinion, and then shortly state my own.

Dr Glisson says: “ Let us compare the bones which
are apt to be curved to a pillar; and indeed we
may do so quite properly, for if they are erect‚ they
correspond to a sort ol pillar, and thence we deduce
a demonstration explanatory of this circumstance:
let, then, a, b,c(Plate1V.‚ Fig. 1) be a pillar com-
posed ol three stones placed one on the top of the
other; we shall suppose it such that every side is
perpendicular and of the same height; if, then, we
insert a wedge on the right side between the stones
a and b, along the line f, d, the head ol the pillar,
that is, the highest stone, will be inclined towards
d, and make an angle at d, and the height of
the pillar will be greater on the right side than on

the lest, as is shown in Plate lv, Fig. 2. similarly,
it you push in another wedge along the line g, e,
between the storres b and c, the pillar will be still
further inclined, and there will be arr angle at e. The
