particles which are also elastic. So that there should
be no doubt at all now that an ae'rial something
absolutely necessary to life enters the blood of animals
by means ol respiration. And indeed if the necessity
for breathin g arose, as some have imagined, merely from
this that the mass oi the blood should be churned and
divided into the most minute parts by the movement
of the lungs, there would certainly be no reason why
an animal, enclosed in a glass vessel in the manner
described, should die so soon, because the air there
avails as much alter the death of the animal as before
to inflate the lungs and cousequently to churn the
mass ol the blood. For as that air is impelled by
the pressure of nearly the whole atmosphere, there is
nothing to hinder it from being urged into the dilated
thorax of the animal, and on this the inflation of the
lungs depends, as we have shown elsewhere. ’
There is now no reason therefore lor denying the
entrance of air into the blood because on account of
the dulness of our senses the vessels by which it enters
cannot be seen. For other ducts which serve to
convey thicker liquids are not seen by the eye until
their different capillaries, alter a passage of some length,
unite in a noticeable canal. For what keenness of
vision has ever beheld the sources of the lymphatic or
lacteal vessels or even of the veins? How much less
may one discern these ae'rialducts' which must be very
short and extremely small, for these ducts do not, like
the others, run any considerable distance and at last
join one another, but merely pass separately by a very
short and obscure route through the membranes oi
the lungs ; for that the a'e'rial particles should be mixed
with the blood in the minutest and most intimate way,
it is necessary that they enter the blood by vessels or
rather pores almost infinite in number, distributed, here
