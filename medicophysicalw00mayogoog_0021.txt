under water and in a place free from air, p. 9. The llame of
nitre is produced by the igneo-aerial particles contained in
it, p. 10. But not by sulphureous particles, as nitre does
not contain such, p. 10. For the production os flame
sulphureous and igneo-aerial particles are required, p. 11.
Sulphureous matter cannot be set on fire without aerial
pabulum, p. 11. Why, sor the kindling os nitre, it is not so
much air, as sulphureous matter, that is required, p. 11.
Why the flame of nitre is so impetuouS, p. 12. The access
of external air promotes the kindling os nitre, p. 12. The
igneo-aerial particles contained in nitre seem to constitute its
aerial part, p. 13 ; see pp. 82 and 83. The aerial and igneous
part of nitre exists in the spirit of nitre, p. 13. The spirit os
nitre is compound‚ derived partly from terrestrial matter, but
-also partly from the air, p. 13. Why the igneous particles os
air should be called nitro-aerial spirit, p. 14. The caustic
character of the spirit of nitre arises from its aerial part,
namely, from its igneo-aerial particles, p. 14. Why that
spirit, in distillation‚ appears ol a ruddy colour, p. 14.
Why spirit of nitre does not go on fire although it contains
igneousparticles, p. 14.

lt is shown that the igneo-atirial spirit is of a nitro-saline
character, p. 16. Yet the igneo-aeria] salt is neither acid
nor alkaline, p. 16. The form of flame chiefly depends on
the nitro-aerial particles, p. 16. lt can be produced from a
certain kind of particles only, p. 17. What part the sulphu-
reous particles take in the production os fire, p. 17. What is
the essence of fire, p. 18. The caustic nature of spirit os nitre
andos flame arises from the same igneo-aerial particles, p. 18.
Why we think of the sulphureous rather than of the a'e‘rial
particles as burning, p. 19. lt is shown by experiments that fire
is especially produced by nitro-aerial particles, p. 19. On the
fire produced by the rays os the sun concentrated by means
ola mirror, p. 20. Why antimony calcined by the solar
rays becomes diaphoretic and increases in weight‚ p. 20.
