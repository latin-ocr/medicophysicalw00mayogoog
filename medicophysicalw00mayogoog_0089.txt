OF THE RA TIONAL CA USE OF ELASTICITY

So much then for the cause of rigidity. It remains
to inquire why rigid bodies when bent spring back oi
. themselves to their original shape-for in this lies the
explanation oi elastioity. But to pave the way to
our view of the subject the following must be premised.

In the first place, let us consider in how many ways
· rigid bodies can be heht, and what sort ol change as

to their shape they undergo when bent. Suppose then p

arigid body with its sides equal and parallel such as
that delineated in Plate I., F ig. 4,

In the first place, this rigid body can be bent by
elongating its convex suriace while the concave surlace
remains of the same length as before inflexion‚ as is
shown in Plate 1., F ig. 5, where let a, c, b, n, d, be the
beut rigid body whose concavo suriace a, a, is supposed
to be equal to the length oi the rigid body before in-
flexion but whose convex suriace b, n, d, is elongated
by as much as the line b, n, d, is longer than the line
a, c.

The second mode of bending a rigid body is that in
which the convex suriace is drawn inwards towards
the concave suriace—all the surfaces oi the rigid body
retaining meanwhile their original length as is shown
in Plate L, Fig. 5, where let a, c, - b, e, d, be the bent
rigid body whose convex suriace b, e, d, we suppose,
while the rigid body is beot, to be brought just sofar
inwards as to be equal to the concave suriace a, c,
that is to the length of the rigid body before inflexion.
And indeed if all the sides of rigid bodies are to retain
when bent their original length, they can be bent in
