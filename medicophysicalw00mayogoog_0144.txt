On Sal thm and Nitro-At'rial Spr'rit 107

the particles ol any substance when effervescing in un·
confined air are so much pressed by the weight and
pressure ol the incumbent atmosphere that they can-
not expand freely 3 while yet the same particles, being
scarcely burdened at· all in a place void ol air, will in
performing their movements spread out and swell up
much more : but this does not come from their more
intense action and motion, but from the removal ol
the hindrance. And hence it is that if water slightly
warmed be put in a place void os air, its more agile
particles will make the liquid swell and as it were hoil,
and yet it is not to be supposed that these particles
are agitated with a greater force than before. So that
clearly, even if the fermentation ola mixture os con-
trary liquids in a vacuum were to go on with less force
than in free air, still their fermenting particles would
spread out toa greater extent than otherwise owing
to the withdrawal of the pressure of the atmosphere.
, To this I add that contrary salts‚ if mixed together
in a vacuum and then quickly removed alter eller-
vescence has gone on for some time, do not appear to
have been heated as much as in other circumstances.
So that it would appear that even the heat ol contrary
salts fermenting together, depends to some extent on
nitro-aerial particlcs struck out from the air, as we
have already hinted.

It is besides to be noted that there is a great
difference between the fermentation of the blood and
that of contrary salts‚ inasmuch as the effervescence of
the latter is due to an internal principle, namely to
nitro-aerial particles contained in them, as I already
endeavoured to show, while the fermentation of the
blood is excited by the nitro-a'e'rial spirit supplied by the
air meeting its saline-sulphureous particles. Whence
it is, that the access of air is not so necessary for the
