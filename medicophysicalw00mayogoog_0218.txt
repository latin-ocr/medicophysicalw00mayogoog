proper maturity, by the waters which flow from the
effervescing mineral.

Should any one now ask how any mineral can
possibly suffice for so long-continued a fermentation,I
reply that the earth is imbued in certain places with
a mineral seed, which, like vegetable seed, grows and
reaches maturity; and that owing to it the waste of
the said mineral is constantly repaired.

Finatly, we remark here that nearly all springs
have a certain warmth at their first rise; and indeed
the heat ol spring-water just escaping from the earth
can be quite sensibly felt in winter when the hand is
immersed init. No doubt the aerial particles which
descend with rain-water into the earth effervesce in an
obscure motion with the saline-sulphureous particles
ol which nearly every kind of earth is composed3 and
consequentlya certain warmth is produced, on which
the growth of vegetables depends‚ as has been else·
where shown. And hence it is that spring-waters are
for the most part impregnated with acidosaline salts.
For ii salt oi tartar is mixed with spring-water, pre-
cipitation usually takes place in it, and, like the
aforesaid thermal writers, it becomes whitish-a clear
prooi of the presence in the water of a salt of an acid
nature. And this, too, is the reason that soap does
not mix with spring-water; sor the acid saltos such
water contends with the hxed salt of the soap, and so
destroys its powers that the sulphureous and oily part
of the soap cannot be dissolved in the spring-water by
the fixed salt, now subdued, but floats on the surface
in accordance with its oily nature. Moreover the acid
salt ol spring-water seems to be combined with a
certain alkaline salt, although the latter be immature ς
and therefore it is, that oil of vitriol‚ when mixed
with this water, produces a kind of effervescence.
