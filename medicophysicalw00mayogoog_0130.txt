this seems to be the reason that the north wind is very

with nitroaerial particles and these extremely cold and
dry. And as ae‘rial particles are thus raised alost when
deprived ol nitroaerial spirit and being then anew
impregnated with it return thence to the lower regions,
the a'e'rial particles seem to circulate like a macrocosmic
blood in a perpetual circuit, and even the air itself, as

H1THERTO we have treated ol nitro-aerial spirit and
its effects upon plants and other natural things—it
remains for us to inquire into the office it fulfils in
the case of animals. In our treatise on Respiration
published some time ago various considerations in-
duced me to maintain that the chiel use of respiration,
that, namely, which makes it so necessary, is that
particles of a certain kind, absolutely necessary for the
support of animal lile, may be separated from the air
by means of the lungs and mixed most minutely with
the mass ol the blood3 and in confirmation of our

opInion we brought forward in the previous chapter
experiments by which it was shown that the air
' expelled from the lungs of animals is deprived of
