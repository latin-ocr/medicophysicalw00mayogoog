CHAPTER 111

OF THE NATURE OF Nlrro-AE'RIAL AND IGNEOUS
SPIRIT

Fnow what has been already said, it is, I think, to
some extent certain what the nature ol the nitro-adrial
and fiery spirit is. For since the airial and igneous
part of nitre, or what is the same thing, nitro-aerini

spirit, exists in the aeid spirit of nitre and constitutos
its more active part, it follows that the nitro-aerial
and fiery spirit is ol a nitro-saline nature, and has the
character rather ol an aeid, than of a fixed, salt. And,
assuredly, the effects of fire seem to agree well with an

extremely subtle and highly corrosive salt, as will be
shown immediately. It must, however, be remarked
that this igneous salt is in no way hostile to fixed
salts, but, on the contrary, rather intensifies their
power than diminishes it as acid liquids do. For
fixed salts when heated in the fire become more acrid
and caustic in their nature. Certainly the acid spirit
of nitre seems to be opposed to fixed salts only as

regards its terrestrial and humid part, but not as to .

its dry and fiery part. Nay‚ there is not so much
contrariety, I think, as is commonly supposed
between fixed salt and any acid, as will be more
fully expounded below.

But let us consider in the next place the part which
nitro-aerial spirit, or what is the same thing, the
aeria] part of nitre, plays in producing fire. On this
point my opinion is that the form of flama is chr‘ejly
due to the m'tro-a'e'rt'al spirit set in motion. For I do not
