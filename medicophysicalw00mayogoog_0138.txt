tion produced by the fumes, instead of with air, then the
water did not rise in the glass after the second action
as it did before, because that exhalation could not,
like air, be diminished as to its volume by the ferment·
ing particles, but was on the contrary increased by
thern. But this sort of exhalation will be discussed
more fully later.

After this experiment we must suppose that air
when breathed by animals loses its clastic force in·the
following manner. For I assume, in the first place,
that the mass of the blood is a liquid conspicuously in
a state of fermentation, as will be shown below. Since
then through the action of the lungs aerial particles
are mixed intimately and in the minutest parts with
its fermenting particles, it comes to pass that the aerial
particles have their elastic force diminished by the

particles of the blood in the same way as by the

vapours of fermentation in the aforesaid glass. Indeed
it is probable that the fermenting particles of the blood
rub the adrial particles interspersed among them and
strike out from them the nitro-aerial spirits, and that
at last the aetial particles, deprived of their nitro-aerial
and elastic particles, become unfit for sustaining life
and lose besides a part of their elasticity.

Now that we have introduced nitro-adrial particles
into the mass of the blood, the question at once
follows what use they serve. I discussed this subject
in my treatise on Respiration published a good while
ago. Let mehe permitted, however, to add some
things here. It is our opinion, then, that as in
vegetables so also in animals, nitro-adrial particles are
the principal instrument of life and motion.

For in the first place nitro-aerial spirit when mixed
with the saline-sulphureous particles os the blood
appears to excite in it vital fermentation. ln fact, just
