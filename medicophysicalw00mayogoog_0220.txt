Others again suppose that the air about the chest,
pushed forward by its expansion, propels that which is ,
next it, and this again the next 3 and that so the pro·
pulsion goes on, and thus at last the air near the
mouth is driven into the lungs.

But indeed this view assumes that every place is
full and that this immense space cannot admit any
additional air, however little. But there is no reason
for having recourse to this fulness when the thing can
be and ought to be explained otherwise ; for we may
believe that propulsion ol that kind cannot take place
in air, as it isa fluid and easily moved. But this will
be made clearer by the following experiment. For
let us suppose that the narrow neck of a large enough
glass vessel is put into one's mouth ; then, the nostrils
being firmly closed, let the air be sucked from the
glass and drawn into the lungs, which will certainly
happen if inspiration begins, the chest being dilated.
But certainly in this case, such a propulsion of the
air from the thorax to the lungs cannot be propa·
gated, because of the interposition of the glass.
But perhaps you will say that some more subtle
matter passes through the glass and is pushed into
the thorax, and that this serves as material lor respira-
tion. But indeed if the case were s0, how could it be
explained that a small animal shut up in a completely
closed glass will soon die, if particles suitable for
respiration still pass through the glass?

With respect, then, to the entrance of the air into
the lunga, I think it is to be maintained that it is
caused in the following manner by the pressure ol the
atnrosphere. For as the air, on account ol the weight
oi the superincumbent atmosphere, not only rushes
into all empty placeS, but also presses forcibly upon
whatever is next it (as Boyle's experiments have put
