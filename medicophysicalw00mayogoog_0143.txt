off is soon coagulated and acquires a certain consist-
ence. But such things as are possessed of consistence,
even in the opinion of this learned man, generate heat
in effervescing. Further, blood abounds beyond all
other liquids in saline-sulphureous particles, and nitro—
ae'rial spirits are densely and most minutely mixed
with them, and when these effervesce together, as it is·
their nature to d0, an intense enough heat must arisea

is not supplied directly from the air with motion
and vigour but is innate in these liquids themselves,
wrapt in the embrace ol the salt and fixed, as hasbeen
shown elsewhere.

But yet another difficulty brought forward by this
eminent man opposes what has been said-viz, that tlte
action aad lreat of contrary salto effervescing together
are zacreased in a vacuum, as is proved by Boyle‘s
experimento. Wherefhre, if the beat ⁰f tlte blood were
caused by itsfermentation, it would seem that it ought
to becomemore intense when the air is wzthdraaan. But
on the contrary, af by suppresst'ng respiration air is pre·
ventedfrom entering the blood, fermentation soon ceases
and the am'mal quz'ckly dies.

Ireply that from the fact that the fermentation of
the blood immediately ceases on account ol want of
air, it follows that it is caused by nitro-aerial spirit, as
has just been said.

Further, although contrary salts when mixed to
gether, and other things ola like kind when ferment·-
ing, expand and rise more in a place void of air than
elsewhere, still it is by no means on that account to
be granted that they effervesce more intensely. For
