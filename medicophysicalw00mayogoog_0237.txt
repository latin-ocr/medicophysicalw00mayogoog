convulsive movement of the body accompanied bya
sudden shout.

The asthmatic paroxysm which accompanies palpi-
tation of the heart will be discussed in the Seventh
Chapter of the Treatise On Muscular Motzon.

So much then for inspiration which is effected by
the aforesaid museles. When, however, their con-
traction ceases the ribs sink of their own accord to
their natural position, and the diaphragm‚ now relaxed
and flaccid‚ is raised into the cavity of the thorax by
the upward pressure of the viscera. And this we
have said takes place without any muscular action in
the case of a dead animal. And finally, when the
chest is narrowed at almost every part, the lungs
must be compressed by it and the air expelled; so
that clearly the lungs do not subside of themselves, but
follow the movement of the thorax.

But to more violent expirations the abdominal
museles also contribute. For the obliquely ascending
and descending museles (whose tendons are inserted
into the lower ribs)‚ in their contraction‚ draw the
ribs downwards and narrow the chest. Further, the
whole abdominal museles simultaneously contracting‚
press the viscera which lie under them, so that the
diaphragm is driven by their pressure and forcibly
urged up into the chest. And any one can find out
in his own case that iu sneezing‚ coughing, laughing,
and in every violent expiration, the museles of the
abdomen are drawn together and contract. Hence in
laughter and in violent expirations the hypochondria
often suffer pain from the convulsion of the aforesaid
museles.

From this we gather that laughter takes place
without any action or contraction of the diaphragm.
For in laughter the diaphragm is not, as some have
