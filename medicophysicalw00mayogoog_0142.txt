On Sal Nitrum and Miro-Amal spirit 105

result which is due as I have tried to show elsewhere
to the motion of nitro-aerial particles. How much
greater then will be the effervescence and heat ol the
blood which abounds in saline-sulphureous particles
duly exalted, and with which ae‘rial particles are densely
aud in their minutest parts mixed by the action ol the
lungs? To this l add that the very intense heat which
animals experience when urged to violent motion, arises
partly because in violent movements there is very
great need of increased respiration, and thus the nitro·
ae'rial particles introduced into the blood in greater
abundance will produce greater effervescence and heat
than usual; for the friction of the limbs in the most
violent movements is not so great as to be able to ex·
cite so fervid a heat. N ay, it any one breathes, even
when at rest, but a little more intensely, he will soon
feel himself in an unusual glow of warmth. However
the heat excited in animals by violent exercise is in
part also due to the effervescence ol nitro-aerial particles
and sulphureous particles, originating in the motor
parts, as will be pointed out elsewhere.

Iam not unaware that the learned Dr Willis in his
treatise on the Heat of the Blood has advanced various
arguments by which he endeavours to show that
the heat of blood is not due to its fermentation.
‘lhis eminent man also asserts that liquids never
acqm're beatzizfermenting. But indeed it is evident
from common experience that all the thicker and
richer liquors‚ those namely which abound in saline-
sulphureous particles, such as strong ale and the
like, grow somewhat warm in the course of fermenta-
tion. However there is no kinship between any other
liquids and the mass ol the blood, since the latter is so
thick that its particles do not exist in a fluid state
except when fermenting. Hence blood when drawn
