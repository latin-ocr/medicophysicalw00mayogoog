pressure, whether owing to the nitro-aerial and elastic

particles struck out of the aerial particles colliding with
each other in thunder, or on account ol sulphureous
exhalations kindled here and there throughout the
air; for aerial particles when deprived ol nitro-atirial
particles, whether by combustion or in any other way,
lose their clasticity, as was previously pointed out.
Hence it is that the air, rushing from every quarter, is
borne with rapid motion to that place where the
pressure ol the air is diminished. But these atirial
torrents rushing from opposite points produce, in their
passage, a sudden and impetuous wind, and when at
last they meet and dash against each other they are
bent in all directions and driven round in a circle,
since the air rushes from all directions and allows no
outlet for their escape; and this seems to be the
cause of the violent whirlwinds which suddenly arise.

CHAPTER XIV

OF THE HEAT OF QUICKLIME. INCIDENTALLY OF
THE COMBINA TION OF OPPOSITE SALTS

Now that we have discussed nitro-aeria] spirit in so
lar as it is the cause of fire and heat, it will not be out
-of keeping with our plan to treat of quicklime, in
which, when it is sprinkled with water, nitro-aerial
and igneous particles manifest themselves with very
intense heat. With regard to the heat of quicklime,
the learned Willis has maintained in his treatise on
Fermentation that in consequence ol the long-con·
tinued calcination of the calcareous stone, igneous
