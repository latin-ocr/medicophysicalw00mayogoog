88 Mayow

not easily permit it to descend out ol the glass. So that
it may be clearly inferred that air is deprived, by respir-
ation 3ηά by the burning ol lires, ol certain solid and
heavy particles‚ because it becomes lighter when it
passes out from flame or from the lungs of animals.
Here one is led to admire the providence of the
highest and best Artificer by whose most wise counsel
it has been arranged that air, when deprived of its
nitro-aerial particles 3ηά vital spirit, should lose at

, once its elasticity 3ηά its weight, so that it is borne

alolt by the elastic force and pressure ol the remaining
air 3ηά fresh air comes in place ol the effete ; lor
otherwise there would be no society at allos men
or even ol animals, lor we should be obliged to spend
our lives single 3ηά separate, namely‚ where a ration
ol nitroaerial spirit sufficient lor sustaining lile might
be obtained for each. And indeed between mortals

there would be perpetual strile about the acquisition
and the determination of the boundaries not so much
of fields as of tracts ol air. Moreover the lile of each

would be a sort of perpetual pilgrimage‚ inasmuch as
we should find it necessary to wander by night 3ηά by
day, through the world 3ηά in desert places, not so
much to gain wealth and foreign dainties as to hunt
alter a'e'rial nourishment, and to banish ourselves far
to avoid the popular breath. But how much better
has our best Father consulted lor us, who has lashioned
this air which surrounds us with such skill, that nitro·
aerial spirit, the most necessary Elixir ol lile, should
come to us everywhere of its own accord-nay‚ even
rush uninvited into our very mouths 3ηά inmost
vitals.
