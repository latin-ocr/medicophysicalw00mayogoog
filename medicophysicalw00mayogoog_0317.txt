On Muscular aklotion and Animal Spirits 281

cause; for these symptoms seem in the said diseases
to come not so much from a deficiency of animal
spirits as from a disorder ol the blood and of the
muscular flesh.

We may note by the way, that the slighter
convulsions, like those twitchings of the tendons
which trouble many in continued severs, may to some
extent arise from a diseased condition of the muscular
flesh, in so lar as not only the saline-sulphureous
but also the nitro-aeria] particles passing through the
now nearly wasted away parenchyma ol the flesh,
are transmitted into the motor parts, and by their
mutual effervescente the often slight contractioris ol
the fibrils are, as is likely, produced.

From what has been said, the reason can be given
why bodily exercises are so useful in the icteric
disease and scorbutus, and also for warding off the
paroxyms of intermittent severs. For in exercise the
nitro-aerial particles are sent in greater abundante
into the mass of the blood by the more intense
respiration, and the motion of the blood is much
promoted by the contractiori of the muscles; whence
it comes about that the fermentation ol the blood
is increased and it is comminuted and worked up.
F urther, the saline-sulphureous particles brought to
vigour are secreted from the blood and used up in
muscular contraction‚ and it is by their excess in the
mass ol the blood that febrile heat is excited, as has
been elsewhere said.
