we should expect from our supposition, for the nutri-

tious juice of the brain, which in other cases isin
great part seut into the spinal marrow, here, as that
road is closed, is all dispensed by the cerebral nerves.
Hence, as the head is supplied by these nerves turgid
with nutritious juice, it obtains a more liberal supply
of nutriment and· necessarily grows in a more than
proportional degree. Hence, also, the face is better
conditioned and the mind more acute than accords
with the age, for as the exhaustion of the spirits
makes us torpid and languid‚ so their abundance, con·
gested in the brain, makes us wise and ingenious.

2. The¹ abdominal viscera are wont for the most
· part to exceed the normal proportiou; and here the
same argument holds as in the case of the head, for
it has been certainly made out that all those plexuses
ol nerves devoted to the service of the lower part
of the abdomen are for the most part derivatives of
the vagus and of the intercostal nerves, which have
their origin from the brain; so that we need not
wonder if these viscera grow largely, enjoying as
they do a fuller nourishment brought by the said
nerves. For although the nerves of an intercostal
pair receive brauches from the spinal marrow, which
can bring no nutritious juice, still that delect is
abundantly compensated by the fuller supply from
the brain. As to the liver and the other parenchymata,
which seem to consist mainly of affused blood, per-
haps the nervous juice is not so necessary for their
nutrition. But as the muscles of the abdomen which
cover these organs derive their nerves from the spinal
marrow, aud as they cannot bring any nutriment at
all from that dried-up fountain, it follows that the
viscera within swelling up, press with their mass
against these muscles and make them tense, as the
