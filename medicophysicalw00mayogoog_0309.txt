On Muscular Motion and Animal Spirits 273

cerebellum and the nerves arising lrom it only gently
and with a constantly even flow; particularly in the
uterus, where, namely, the infant does not yet exercise
the respiratory organs. Whence it comes that the
spleen cannot be of any use, in so lar, that is to

say, as the nitro-aerial particles traversing the cere-
bellum in a slender stream are almost all required
for the natural functions: but when the animal has
grown up and exercised itself in violent labours, it is
necessary that these nitro-aetial particles should be
transmitted through the cerebellum in greater
abundance, so that the nitro-aeria} spirits may now

make for themselves sufficiently open channels in the
cerebellum, and that the structure of the brain may
become more compact and firm, and so the nitro·
aerial particles in the luture may more easily and in
fuller rush pass through the brain and the nerves
arising from it. But when these are not all required
for carrying on iu the usual way the natural functions,
it is most necessary that the superabundance of nitro-
aerial particles should be discharged into the mass of
the blood and most intimately mixed with it by
means ol some organ, such as the spleen.

Ι add, besideS, that while the foetus is in the uterus,
the viscera devoted to the digestion of food have
either nothing to do, or at all events act very remissly.
Whence it happens that the nitro-aerial spirits do
not go at all to these viscera, or at all events only in
very small amount; and there is thus no need that
any part ol thern should be diverted to the spleen.
Further, as the infant immediately alter birth takes
food continuously, or at all events at frequently
repeated times, so that its stomach is to some extent
filled with food, and consequently the nitro-aerial
spirits ought to come to the viscera devoted to
