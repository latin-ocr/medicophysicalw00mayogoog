On Muscular Motion and Anzinal sz'rits 249

buted to the motion of the body itsell, but indeed in
animal motion there is no such friction of the parts
(from which alone heat arises) as could account for so
intense a lervour. We must, therefore, believe that
the heat ol strongly contracting muscles eomes from
nitroaerial particles, at that time much agitated in
the muscles; as 1 have endeavoured elsewhere to
show that every kind ol heat arises from their
motion.

l may here note by the way that the ancients, not
altogether without reason, supposed that the source
ol vital heat was in the heart; not that a sort
os szlyclmz'um‚ whatever that may be, constantly
fiamed in its sacred cloisters, but that, inasmuch as
the heart is unweariedly at work in continuous labour
for keeping up the motion of the blood, the nitro-
ae'rial and the sulphureous particles effervesce con·
tinuously in its muscular part, and that by their
motion a notable heat must be produced.

Further, from the foresaid hypothesis a reason
can be deduced why the sweat given out in violent
movements is ola saline character, and very penetrat-
ing. For the extremely subtle nitro-aerial, as also
the saline-sulphureous particles, by which when mixed
together the contraction of the muscles is produced,
when forced out along with the serous liquid, render
it acrid and very penetrating. The reason why the
sweat is acido-saline seems to be that the volatile salts
ol the blood, intimately combined ,with sulphureous
particles, are partly brought to a liquid state hythe
effervescence which takes place in the muscular
contraction, in the way elsewhere described.

From what has hitherto been said, it is to some¹
extent proved that muscular motion depends on'
nitro-aerial and saline-sulphureous particles mutually
