On MuscuIar Motion and Animal Spm’ts 297

muscles, is liable to convulsive movements, and its
palpitation seems sometimes to be referable to these.

As to the asthmatic paroxysm, to· which the afore-
said patient was subject alter any more violent
motion, that seems to have arisen thus, that the
blood which, on account of the contractiori of the
muscles, reached the right ventricle of the heart in
a fuller stream, could not freely pass through the
lungs and make its way to the left ventricle ol the
heart. But I would not have this so understood as
if I supposed that the blood detained in the lungs so
stuffed thern up as to prevent the entrance ol air
into them; for, however the blood-vessels of the
lungs are distended with blood or any other liquid,
the lungs themselves do not swell up; but all the
same they do enlarge when air is blown into them,
and quite promptly subside when the air is expelled,
as may be tested on the body of any animal by
passing blood or any other liquid into the pulmonary
vein after ligature of the pulmonary artery, and then
inflating the lungs by means ol bellows attached to
the trachea. And in lact if the blood stagnate in the
pulmonary vessels, the patient is affected just as if
the respiration were suppressed; lor there are two
things specially effected by the respiration :-

First, that the mass of the blood should be led
through the lungs into the left ventricle of the heart
(yet that takes place not so much for the motion of
the lungs, as that the blood may ferment with the
nitro-a'e'rial particles mixed with it by respiration,
and be protected from coagulation, as has been shown
above) Wherefore, il the blood for any reason
should stagnate in the lungs, as happened in the
case mentioned, the patient at once becomes breathless,
and suffocation is nearly produced.
