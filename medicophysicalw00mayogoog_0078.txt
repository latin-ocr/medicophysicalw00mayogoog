On Sal Nitmm and Miro-Aine] Spirr't 41

closely united with nitrous salt that they are not
separated from each other by calcinationÍ¾ but the
burning sulphureous particles carry the nitrous par-
ticles away with them as vapours. And hence it is
that plants 01 this sort yield only a small quantity
of fixed salt, as is the case with resinous woods, such
as Lignum sanctum and the like.

Nor should it be overlooked that the nitre innate
in plants contributes not a little to their burning, and
that those which abound the most in nitrous par-
ticles take lire at once, even when they are green
and full 01 moisture. Among these the ash is espe-
cially remarkable, for be it ever so green it yet burns
with a bright flame. But, indeed, its richness in nitre
may be inferred from the fact that while burning
it gives out, 110111 tirne to time, cracks like kindled
nitre.

Thus far, we have considered the fermentation
tending 10 the production 01 plants. We have still
10 inquire shortly as to the internal motion by which
plants rush to their destruction.

In regard to this, it is our opinion that the ler-
mentation which tends to the destruction 01 plants is
also caused by the mutual agitation 01 the nitro-aerial
and saline-sulphureous particles-with this distinction,
however, that in the origin 01 vegetables, nitro-aerial
spirit, when put in vigorous movement, attacks sul-
phur existing in a fixed state, and when the sulphur
has been brought to volatility, the nitro-aerial spirit
is fixed, imprisoned in saline bondS, as hasbeen shown
above. But, on the other hand, in the destruction
01 things, the internal movement is 101 the most part
set up by the sulphur being too highly exalted. ln
lact, the sulphureous particles in a state 01 100 vigorous
movement attack the nitro-aerial spirit when lying
