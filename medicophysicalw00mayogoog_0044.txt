It is shown that tle Spirit ff Nitrc is a compound body, and that it is
derived partly from the air and partly from terrestrial matter.
First, oJ'r'ts airzialpart.

Iu the previous chapter we treated generally of the
elements of which nitre is composed, and specially
of its more fixed part, the sal alkala} to wit. Let us
look, in the next place, at the source of the other
clement of the nitra-via, its aeid spirit. Regarding
this, Ι was lor some time in doubt whether nitrous
spirit in a state of the finest subdivision did not reside
in the air and, fleeting to and fro and permeating all
things in virtue of its most penetrating nature, instantly
assail‚ whether from hate or rather from some cou-
jugal affection, whatever fixed or volatile salt it at any
time encountered in its wandering path ; and whether
these two, closely united together, did not appear to
coalesce in a tertz'um qual, to wit, common nitre.
And assurcdly there are arguments of no little weight
which cau be advanced in support of this hypothesis.
For any other source than the air for the acid spirit of
nitre is scarcely conceivahle, since sul rutrum is gener-
ated in earth which is in uo way impregnated with
an acid salt. It is also to be noted that all salts what·
ever, fixed and volatile, as also vitriols, if calcined to
the complete expulsiou of the acid spirits, acquire
when exposed ior some time to the air a certain
