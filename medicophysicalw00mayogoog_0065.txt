closely involved with the sulphureum, so the same
nitro-aerial spirit effervescing in a slower motion
with saline-sulphureous particles, changes the saline
particles into an aeid liquor only after some time bas
elapsed. And an example of this is to be sought in
witriol when calcined to the entire removal of the
acid spirit. For if that vitriol hasbeen exposed for
some time to moist air it will be impregnated anew
with aeid spirit. Indeed, nitro-aerial spirit encounters
the metallic sulphur of colcothar in a gentle manner
and effervesces with it in an obscure way, whence it
is that the saline or metallic particles of the sulphur
are brought in the manner aforesaid to a state of
fluidity. Certainly we can scarcely imagine any
other mode for the formation of the vitriolic spirit
in colcothar, lor it does not arise in the colcothar
immediately after distillation, and we cannot suppose

(as has been elsewhere shown) that it is entirely de-
rived from the air.

Further, the aeid spirit of which vitriols are
, composed seems obviously to be produced in the same
way. ‘For vitriols are produced from the stone or
rather the saline-sulphureous earth usually called
Marchasite, and from it on the application ol lire
the flowers of common sulphur are elicited in con-
siderable abundance. But after this earth has been
exposed for some time to the air and wet weather and
then (as its nature is) has fermented spontaneously, it

will be found to be richly impregnated with vitriol. ¹

No doubt the nitro-aerial spirit, effervescing with the
metallic sulphur ol these Marchasitcs‚ converts their
more fixed part into an aeid liquid which, directly it
is produced, attacks the metallic particles of the said
stone and draws them out and at last coalesces with
them to form vitriol.
