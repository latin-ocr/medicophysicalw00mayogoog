absolutely required not only for nutrition but also

And so, in fine, we have deduced the symptoms
ol this disease from obstruction of the spinal marrow,
as its source.

And here it may be asked how it comes about that
older persons are never attacked by this disease,
seeing that they, as well as inlauts, suffer from obstruc-
tion of nerves, as iu paralysis and other diseases of
that kind. I answer that although perhaps children
are chiefly liable to this disease, yet adults sometimes
suffer from the same disorder under another name.
Yet that the abovedescribed symptoms for the most
part never appear in older patients, arises from a
difference not ol disease but of age. For as the
great size of the head, the curvature of the bones,
and some other of the symptoms are produced by the
abnormal increase in size ol parts, it is altogether
impossible that adults, already at the limit ol growth,
zie, unable to grow any more at all, should grow
abnormally: so that in adults suffering lrom this
disease the head does not, as in children, increase
beyond its proper size, because the head has already
attained the limit ol growth which the very laws of
nature forbid it to exceed. But while the parts
cannot increase abnormally in adultS, still the disease
'does the one thing that in their case it can, by
emaciating them.

As to the prognosis, this disease is usually not
lethal in itself ; yet sometimes by the aggravation ol
the symptoms it degenerates into PhthisiS, Tabes,
Hectic cher, Dropsy of the Lungs or Ascites, and so
at last is fatal to the patient. But the prognosis can
be more easily established hythe following rules :—
