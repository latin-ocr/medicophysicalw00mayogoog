particles, ol which it is altogether destitute. And
hence it is that the flame of nitre is very different
from that which is produced by any deflagrating
sulphureous matter. For sulphureous matter burns

when igneo-aeria] particles are supplied from the air,
but nitre from the igneo-aerial particles closely packed
in itsell and breaking forth in deusest array. Hence '
it is that the flante ol nitre is exceedingly impetuous.
T hat the form ol flame depends mainly on the igneo-
aerial particleS, I shall attempt to show later.

But the reason why nitre is chiefly produced in
places that are largely imbued with sulphur will be
evident from what follows.

Since this treatise was written, Boyle‘s experiments
recently published have come into our hands. In the
second of these it is shown that when gunpowder is
kindled‚ by means of a hurning-glass, in a glass freed
from air, the fiame is not propagated‚ as in other cases,
through the whole of its mass, but that only those
grains on which the collected solar rays fall take fire.
So that it appears that the access of air is necessary
even for the kindling of gunpowder. Ireply that
although that powder will deflagrate by means of the
igneo-aerial particles residing in it, in a place where
there is no air, and under water, still the access of
external air contributes in no small degree to its
kindling. For it is to be noted that air, on account
of its great elastic power, lies in the closest proximity
to the sulphureous particles ol the gunpowder and
even presses powerfully against them, whence it is
that when the powder is once ignited in free air
nitro-aerial particles ol the air are never lacking to
keep up the flame; while, on the other hand, the
igneo-aerial particles in gunpowder are intimately
blended with the sulphureous particles only in the in·
