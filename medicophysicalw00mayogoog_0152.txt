not be all pumped out. Therefore if the volume of
the whole glass be measured by means ol water put
into it drop by drop, and compared with the space in
the narrower glass which the residual air had filled,
the extent to which the said air had expanded will be
ascertained. For by as much as theone space exceeds
the other, so much was the expansion ol that air.
And from many repetitions ol the experiment, I have

’ ascertained that air ol that kind expands to more

than two hundred times its volume; and indeedif it
had been relieved from the pressure ol the surround-
ing water, it would have expanded about twice as
much. Nor will common air, when treated in the
same manner, expand more ; but it must be observed
that in making experiments of this kind, every pre-
caution must be taken that the airs, whose clastic
powers are to be compared with one another, are
pressed by an equal weight ol the surrounding water,
and also that the pressure of the surrounding air be
diminished to an equal extent in every experiment,
by pumping.

Inote here in passing that I made an experiment
in a similar way, to find whether the air in which an
animal or a lamp had expired, possessed clastic force
in an equal degree with unimpaired air, and, in fact, it
appears to me to expand no less than any other air, as
was previously said. But in order that experiments
of this kind may be made, it is sometimes necessary
that the air whose elastic force is to be investigated
should be drawn off from the glass which contains it,
and transferred to the glass first described, and this
can be done in the following manner. Let a glass,
not too large, be submerged in the water in which
the glass is which contains the air to be drawn off, so

that it 'is filled with water3 then let this glass be
