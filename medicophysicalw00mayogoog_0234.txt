viscera and the throat‚ arising from nerve communi·
cation may contribute something to this. But
certainly socha constriction of the chest does not

seem to be caused at all by the convulsed 3ηά
elevated diaphragm (as the renowned Dr Willis has
supposed), for we have shown above that when the
diaphragm is convulsed in inordinate systole and
violently connected, it descends and dilates the
chest.

As for asthmatic paroxysms‚ in which the raised
and distended lungs almost cause suffocation, there is
no reason to think that the lungs are inflated by
convulsion oi the pulmonary nerves and thrown into
excessive diastole. For granting that the lungs
sometimes suffer convulsions‚ the contraction and
convulsion of their fibres (if they have any) would
involve rather the collapse and contractiori of the
lungs, as was previously pointed out. Nor is it
probable that the lungs are thus inflated by vapours‚
for flatus contained in the pulmonary veins and
arteries cannot inflate thern. For even though flatus
be introduced by a tube attached to the pulmonary
artery the lungs will not swell. And any vapours
contained in the vesicles of the lungs could certainly
be expelled with ease along with the air. And
therefore, I think, we should maintain that this kind
of suffocation is caused by the convulsed intercostal
muscles and diaphragm, for by their convulsion the
chest is kept dilated too long, so that the lungs
romain ¹inllated 3ηά respiration is interrupted.

Nor should that affection be overlooked here in
which the patient draws breath with difficulty 3ηά
with a whistling sound. This ailment does not seem
to arise always from phlegmatic humours choking
the bronchia, but sometimes also in the following
