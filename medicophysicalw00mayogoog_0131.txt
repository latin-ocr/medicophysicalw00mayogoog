certain elastic particles and in consequence undergoes
contraction.

F urther‚ Ι attempted to show that the elastic force
of inspired air is diminished because the nitro-aerial
particles which are extremely subtle and nimble are
extracted and in a sense struck out from the a'e'rial
particles. But let us now investigate how this is
done.

In regard to this point I for some time suspected
that nitro-aerial and elastic particles are struck out
from the atirial particles by the special structure of the
lungs. But on more full consideration of the matter l
prefer the view that aerial particles enter the mass ol
the blood and are there deprived ol their nitro-aerial
particleS, and in consequence partly lose their elastic
force, a view which is confirmed by the following
experiment.

Thus let a rod equal iu length to the diameter of a
glass bell-jar at its widest part be put inside it, and
placed transversely and drawn downwards till both
ends oi the rod lean upon the sides of the glass and
are supported by them, as is shown in Plate V., F ig. 4.
Next let an earthenware vessel, glazed inside and
capable of holding about tour fluid ounces‚ be hung
from the transverse rod by an iron hook attached
to it, and let it be about half-filled with spirit of
nitre. Further, let some small pieces of iron, tied
together into a bundle and suspended by means of a
string from the rod, be made to hang directly over the
vessel (the string moreover ought to be of such a
length that its other end may reach to the mouth ot
the glass and hang outside‚ in the manner shown in the

figure). These arrangements made, the mouth of the
inverted bell-jar should be sunk in the water about
five finger-breadths, yet so that the water within the
