digestion in an always even flow and without any
regulation, yet when the animal has come to the
limit of its growth it takes lood at fixed periods,
and its stomach is sometimes filled with food and
sometimes nearly empty: and hence it is necessary
that the nitro-aerial particles should be carried now
in larger now in smaller abundance to the viscera of
digestion. But that the afflux of nitro-aerial spirits
to the viscera should take place under control, it is
necessary that there should be some organ in the
parenchyma of which the excess of nitro-aerial spirits
may be deposited, as has been shown above.

As the primary function ol the spleen has no place
in infants, so neither is it necessary that its other
office, that is, the more intense effervescence of the
blood (which we have said takes place in the spleen),
should be exercised in infants. For it is probable
that the said fermentation excited in the spleen has
for its chief effect the bringing of the saline-
sulphureous particles of the blood to a proper
volatility for motive and procreative functions‚ and
these fonctions do not well suit a tender age.

We gather from what follows that an effervescence
of that sort is excited in the parenchyma of the
spleen by the nitro-adrial particles brought along the
nerves and mixed with the saline-sulphureous particles
of the blood.

For it has been made out by observation that if the
spleen is obstructed by scirrhus, the mass of the blood
lacks its proper fermentation and becomes crude and
vapid‚ so that dropsy and chlorosis often result.
But Iconless I do not know whence that fermenta-
tion excited in the spleen should arise, unless from
< nitro-aerial particles along with the saline-sulphureous
particles ol the blood; for Ι cannot agree with those
