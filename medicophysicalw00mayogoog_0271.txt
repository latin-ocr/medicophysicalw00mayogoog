swells as to breadth‚ but becomes less as to length;
and in this waya muscle can be shortened, although
its fibres suffer no contraction.

But whether a changeof this kind takes place in a
muscle‚ and its contractioo depends on this alone,I
shall not say lor certain. still, it does appear to me
that a contracted muscle does not swell up so much as
would be required if its contractiori were caused in
this way. Besides,I do not see what part of the
muscle should sustain the attack of the motive matter
in such contraction‚ for some kind ol membranous
vesicles, rather than muscular cords, would be suitable·
for bearing the force of contraction, and yet the
strength of a muscle seems to proceed from its fibrils
and cords rather than from any kind of vesicles or
membranes. But these things will be discussed more
fully below.

A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF MUSCLES. ALSO WHAT
PART OF A MUSCLE PRIMARIll' CONTRACTS

lu the anatomical dissection of muscles the first thing
that presents itself is a membranous integument spread
in all directions over each muscle; under which come
into view series of fieshy fibres; these, parallel among
themselves, are inserted obliquely into the opposite
tendons, which are parallel one to the other, as the
eminent Steno first observed.

Next, there corne to view the wonderful series of
almost infinite membranous fihrils, which, parallel
among themselves, cut the fieshy fibres obliquely, for
