On Sal Nitrum and Miro-Adnul Spirat 63

it moves. Meanwhile the subtle matter is reflected
from the parts which it strikes, and dashes instantly
against the particles opposite, to be repelled anew.
And so the subtle matter strikes incessantly the parts
of the rigid body, and its particles which are almost
infinite in number and distributed through the whole
mass of the rigid body all cooperate to restore to their
original shape the pores of the rigid body and conse·
quently the rigid body itself. And in this effort the
explanation of elasticity seems to lie.

We remark here in passing that the lorce with
which a string that has been violently stretched cou-
tracts to its original length arises from the same cause.
For although the string itself may be a loose body, yet
its minute fibres are somewhat rigid and their shapc
alters with the extension of the string. But the move-
ment of the contracting string is caused by the eflort
of its fibres to revert to their original form.

From what hasbeen said, we may conjecture why
the glass globules with a sharp beak attached to them,
commonly called glass drops‚ which are formed by
dropping alittle molten glass into cold water, burst
with remarkable and almost explosive violence into
the minutest fragments if the fine end of the beak is
broken. Some imagine that the violence with which
the drops burst is caused by the bendiug aud tension
of the parts of the glass But it is hard to conceive
how the parts ol the said glass can be in a state ol
tension‚ since to produce the tension from which
elastic force results it is an indispensable requisite that
the rigid body alter it has cooled should be bent by
some force or, what amounts to the same thing,
should be stretched. For in whatever way the heated
rigid body or its parts may be bent or distended
while cooling, they will never be under tension unless
