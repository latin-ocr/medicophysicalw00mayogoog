the liquid closely combined with the sulphureous
particles are beaten and rubbed by the nitro·

a'e'rial particles and at last liquefied in the manner
aforesaid. It corroborares this view that wines or
strong ale long exposed to the solar rays or kept in
a warm place turn in the course of time into vinegar.
ln fact the nitro-aeria] particles communicated to
these liquids by the solar rays or by fire (for I
intend to show in another place that every kind of
heat is due to nitro-aeria] particles put in motion)
effervesco with the saline-sulphureous particles of
these liquids‚ with the result that the saline particles
are sharpened by the action of the nitro-aeria}
particles and converted into aeid salts. And what·
ever in fine aids the fermentation of liquids and
throws their particles into violent commotion, as,
for example, very warrn weather and thunder, accel-
erates the souring of the liquids. To this I add that
if common sulphur is dissolved in water in which
quicklime has been slaked‚ or in lye, this solution
which was imbued at first with fixed salt will in
course of time become aeid, so that the sulphur
will not any longer remain dissolved in it.

lt is also to be noted that saline and sulphureous
particles exist in a fluid state in liquids-the conse-
quence being that the saline particles in liquids
cannot be so rubbed and comminuted by the action
of nitro-aerial particles as in the case of solids. And
this seems to be the reason why the aeid salt of
soured liquids is less sharp and corrosive than the
spirit of sulphur and other eminently corrosive liquids
of the same kind.

In the light of what has been said it will not
be difficult to understand how the acid spirit of nitre
is generated in the earth. For it was pointed out
