action, as lor the former, which is indeed avery difficolt
one.

And here it should be noticed that the ribs are
joined to the spine, not as is commonly believed with
a single but with a double articulation, and that these
joints are placed so obliquely, and shaped with such
contrivance, that the ribs cannot be raised by the
intercostal muscles without being at the same time
drawn outwards for the greater dilatation of the
chest, as is clearly seen in Plate 11, Fig. 5: in which
let a, e, ι’, be a portion ol a rib whose round head, a,
enters c, the socket hollowed in the spine; this
articulation is superior and interior. On the con-
trary, in the other articulatim, the lower and
exterior, a cavity, but a less conspicuous one, is
hollowed out in the rib at e, and is articulated with
the protuberance of the spine at b. And now, if we
suppose the head, a, of the rib to be placed in the
socket, c, of the spine, and the hollow of the rib, e, to

' rest on the protuberance, b, of the spine, and then
the rib connected with the spine by these two
articulations to be moved upwards, it is easily under·
stood that the rib will be carried to the left, or, what
is the same thing, outwards, in respect to the chest.

These articulations, and also their obliquity, are
more noticeable in the skeleton of a sheep or of a horse
than in that of a man. For it is to be observed that
these articulations are much rnore oblique in some
animals than in others; in animals, namely, which,
destined lor more violent exercise, have need ol more
violent respiration, the joints of the ribs are very
oblique, in order that their ribs may be drawn more
outwards hythe contraction of the intercostal muscles,
and that space enough may be opened in the chest
for a sufficiently large expansion of the lungs.
