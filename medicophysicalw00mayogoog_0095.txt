trude it towards the sides. Whence it results that
as rigid bodies on bending are attenuated as to their
thickness, so on the other hand they are somewhat in·
creased in breadth.

Since in bending rigid bodies the convex side comes
thus to be lengthened and the concave to be shortened,
the result is that the thinner rigid bodies are, the more
and the more easily can they be bent, for although glass
is very fragile and can scarcely be beot, yet fine threads ¹
of it can be wound round a bobbin and tied in a knot.
But that the reason of thisdifference maybe understood,
let a, c, b, d, in Plate L, F ig. 9, be a very slenderrigid
body whose convex and concave surfaces were equal
before inflexion—but now that it is bent, the con-
vex surface b, d, is a little elongated. Let us suppose
that two points e, e, are so placed in the convex surface
that the line between the limits e, e, is equal to the con-
cave surface a, c, which we suppose to be equal to the
length of the rigid body before inflexion. But now if
the convex surface of the bent rigid body be lengthened
out at both ends, at one end from eto b at the other
from e to d as is done in the figure, then there is no
need for this surface being drawn inwardly when the
rigid body is bent—nor consequently that its matter
should be compressed. And yet this is inevitable in

rigid bodies whose surfaces cannot be elongated‚ as we .

have already shown.

Further‚ if we suppose also that the concave surface
of the rigid body a, c, is shortened as much proportion-
ally as the convex surface is lengthened (for it should
be observed that the force by which a rigid body is
bent tends as has been shown above not only to
draw out the convex surface but also to contract
the concave)-say that the concave surface at each
end is contracted to n, and the convex lengthened
