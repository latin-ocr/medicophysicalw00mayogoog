On Mascular Motion and Am'mal Spiritu* 253

itself with so much force, unless elastic particles were
present in sufficient abundance for its contraction;
and hence it is that in violent exercises the respira-
tion is so much increased that the great expenditure
of animal spirits made in motive effort may be re-
paired.

And not only for muscular motion but also for
sustaiuing life itself, it seems that there is need of an
ample supply of animal spirits ς for it is probable that
life cannot be sustained without a certain series and
continuous flow of animal spirits passing constantly
through the brain, or at all events through the
cerebellum. And that is the reason why, if the
respiration or the motion of the heart or of the blood
be stopped even for a moment, the animal at once
dies. But more fully of this below.

ln confirmation of what has been said, there may be
adduced what the learned Malpighi has observed as
to the Respiration of Insects: via-Inserta which live
when their head is eut effi and the separated portz'ons of
which live, have pneumom'e vessels dzltrz‘buted through
the whole duct of their speizal marrow. For this
eminent man observed that the blaeh points which are
to be found on each side of insects close to the spine,

. are so many spicula or tracheae through which the

insects draw air ; insomuch that if the said spicula be
smeared with oil the animal soon dies from want of
breath. Further, he found out that some branches of
the said tracheae are inserted here and there into the
spinal marrow.

But that we may apply these observations to the
present subject, I think we must allow that the
animal spirits in the more perfect animals are elabor-
ated only in the hrain, and that they are dissemin-
ated from that source to the spinal marrow and to
