As to melancholia and mania, it is probable that
the saline-sulphureous particles of the blood detained
in the parenchyma of the spleen and long effervescing
there with the nitro-aerial spirits acquire an atra-
bilious and malignant character; and that, besides,
they become so subtle that they penetrate deep into

the brain and perturb the animal spirits. For it is
probable that diseases of this kind which concern the
brain arise not so much from a diseased condition of
the animal spirits as from their perturbed motion
or even from their deliciency3 for as the animal
spirits consist ol anethereal matter, they canno

be subject to any change, as we have indicated
above.

It is, besides, required for the establishment ol -

animal life and the motive fonction that the mass ol
the blood should be impregnated with saline·
sulphureous particles duly perlected, so that, namely,
the nitro-a'e'rial particles mixed with thern may excite
a proper effervescence in the mass of the blood.
For it is necessary lor the sustenance ol animal lise
that the saline-sulphureous particles of the blood
should, by continuous fermentation of the blood, be
brought to aproper volatility; so that they being
separated from the blood by means of the muscular
flesh, may be transmitted into the motor parts, as Ι
have endeavoured to show above· But if, indeed, the
saline-sulphureous particles are not properly exalted
by reason of a too slight fermentation of the blood,
or are not promptly enough separated from the mass
of the blood on account of a diseased condition ol
the muscular fiesh, the motive fonction can scarcely
be set up. And so it is probable that the spontaneous
lassitude and incapacity for motion which accompany
scorbutus and the icteric disease proceed from this
