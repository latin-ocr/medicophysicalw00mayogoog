indeed, just as the fleshy fibres are inserted into the
tendons‚ so are the fibrils into the fleshy libres, but
arranged the contrary way; and as the fibres closely
joined together seem to form the tendons, so the
collection of fibrils seems, in part at all events, to
form the fibres themselves; as is seen in Plate 111.,
Fig. a, which shows the series of fibres and of fibrils,
as they are seen in muscles that have been boiled for
a sufficiently long time.

Hitherto it has been held by the authors best
acquainted with anatomy that the fleshy fibres of the
must-le chiefly and primarily undergo contractiori 3 but
in our opinion (which l should wish to express with
all respect) not the fibres but the fibrils inserted trans-
versely into them, take the chief part in muscular
contraction, and this we gather from indications which
are at all events probable. For if the contractiori
took place in the fleshy fibreS, then, for a due contrac-
tion of the muscle, it would be necessary that the
libres should be much more shortened than the
muscle itself; for as the fibres are not arranged
according to the length of the muscle, but are inserted
obliquely into the tendons‚ as may be seen in the
figure referred to, it follows that the contraction of
the muscle is much less than the contractiori of the
fibres ; and that for a proper contractiori of the muscle
it would be necessary that the libres should be con-
tracted much more than the muscle itself: but I do
not think such a great contractiori of the libres really
occurs in motion: for, besides that we cannot in
wivisections see this sort of contractiori of the fibres, if
the fleshy fibres contracted so much, the muscle
should swell enormously‚ but it does not.

Resides, in order that the contractiori of the rnuscle
should be effected by the fibrils, there is no need that
