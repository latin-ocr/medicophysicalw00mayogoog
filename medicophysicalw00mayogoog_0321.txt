In the second place, il one end ol the string to be
contracted were free but the other end bned, that the
free end and also all parts of the string would in
contraction be drawn towards the fixed end; as is
shown in Plate ΙΙΙ., Fig. 4, which represents the string
so arranged and the same when contracted. For in
the said figure not only the free end of the string,
c, but also its middle point, a, and so also all parts of
it, are drawn in the contraction of the string towards
the end, b, which we suppose fixed. And similarly
we infer that isa greater weight be attached to the
one end and a smaller weight to the other, the
smaller weight will in the contraction of the string,
be drawn towards the greater as to a fixed end.

From what has been said, it will not be difficult to
understand the motion of the shortened musclos and
libres. For il a libre, fibril‚ or muscle‚ both of the
ends ol which are free, undergoes contractiori, it is
not to be doubted that both its ends will approach
the centre; but if one of the ends is attached to an
immovable part, as is the case with the muscles which
serve ior local motion, the contraction will be
altogether to the more fixed part; and the movable
end, which in a muscle is called the termination, is
drawn in contractiori towards the immovable end, or
what is the same thing, the head of the muscle. And
this also occurs in the contractione of the fibres or
fibrils. Ι am quite aware that the learned Dr Willis
has expressed a contrary opinion in his treatise
On Muscular Motr'on, for that distinguished man
altogether denies that the libres contract from the
termination towards the origin; and indeed affirms
that when they are shortened, both of their ends are
drawn towards the middle. But with all respect to
such a man, when one end of a fibre is fixed to an
