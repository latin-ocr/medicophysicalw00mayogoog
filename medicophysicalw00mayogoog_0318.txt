CHAPTER VI

OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE FIBRILS CONTRACT.
ALSO, OF THE MOTION OF CONTRACTING MOSCLES

So far as to the motive particles by which muscular
contraction is effected: it remains to enquire how the
muscles are contracted by them. Ι cannot, for reasons
given above, admit that muscles are contracted by the
inflation of the fibres, a view approved by some. Ι
further add that the fibrils‚ which in our opinion
primarily undergo contractiori, seem to be solid
bodies; so that they ,are quite incapable of being
inflated.

As to the contractiori of the fibrils, as far as Ι can
make out from anatomical observation and from
mental conjecture, the fibrils in their contractiori
seem to undergo contortion. Certainly this mode of
contraction of the fibrils‚ namely‚ by contortion, is
most in harmony with the constrictior] and hardness
of contracted muscles Further‚ a contortion of the
fibrils is specially suitable for the very strong pull of
muscles which is sometimes exerted with quite
wonderful force. And to these things we further add,
that the motion of the nitro-aeria] particleS, by which
in our opinion muscular contraction is effected, is of
a sort fitted for twisting the fibrils, as, Ι think, will be
established by the following experiment.

Let a very fine music string be grasped by the
fingers of both hands at a short distance from each
other, and be held a such a height above a lighted

candle that the string may be sufficiently heated but
not burnt. When this is done we shall feel the
string contract with a distinct enough force as it is
