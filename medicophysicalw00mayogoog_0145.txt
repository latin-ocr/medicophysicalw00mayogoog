action os contrary salts. But such things as have not
nitro-aerial particles contained in them, such as the
mass of the blood, all saline-sulphureous minerals, and
likewise such things as ferment from extraneous
moisture and heat, effervesce only when nitro-aerial
particles reach them from the air. And this is the
reason why the fermentation of the blood subsides im·
mediately when the air is withdrawn.

But the reason why blood quickly coagulatos when
drawn off, although exposed to the air, is because it is
necessary for the fermentation, and therefore also for
the preservation oi the fluidityof the blood, that nitro·
ae'rial particles should be mixed densely and in very
minute parts with its saline-sulphureous particles, as
takes place in the lungs. And yet even blood that
hasbeen shed effervesces at its surface, that is, where
it is mixed with the air, as was previously shown.

From what has been already said, it is Ι think in
some degree made out that the fermentation of the
blood, and hence also its heat', arises from nitro·
a'e'rial particles fermenting with its saline-sulphureous
particles; so that we do not need to have recourse to
an imaginary Vital Flame that by its continual burn-
ing warms the mass of the blood, much less to affirm
a degree of heat in the blood intense enough to produce
light, from the rays ol which, transmitted to the hrain,
the Sensitive Soul is supposed to be produced. I
know not what the ancients dreamed about certain
feral fires hidden in the urns of the dead, but now
for the first time the vital flame, if such a thing can
be, is kindled in the viscera of animals, so that we all
now burn like Ucalegon, and there is no reaso'n why
we should any longer wonder ata Salamander living
in the midst of flames. But really fire seems to be
better adapted sor the dissolution and destruction of
