On Sal Nitrum and Mim-Ae'n'al spirit 33

principally produced in such soil as is imbued with
saline· sulphureous particles-aS, for instance, in
daughter-homes, stalls‚ stables, and the like. In fact,

fixed or volatile salts provide suitable material for the
production of nitre‚ but sulphureous particles con-
tribute in no other way to the generation of nitre
than by excihng, when they effervesce with nitro-
a’e'rial particles‚ that heat in the earth's bosom by
which first nitrous spirit is produced and then nitre

itself. For, as has been shown above, the sul-
phureous particles of terrestrial matter must not be
supposed to constitute nitre in part.

It is in sorne measure established I think from what
has been said what the elements are of which sal
nitrum is composed. For it seems to consist of salt
of three kinds, of which one, the most active, is derived
from the air, and it has an ethereal and fiery nature.
This salt, as an architect, forges for itself from terres-
trial matter a saline vehicle in which, as in a fitting
subject, it resides. The saline vehicle along with the
fiery salt which occupies it forms the spirit of nine,
which from the moment of its production meets the
fixed salts of the earth which have attained to proper
maturity‚ and coalesces with thern to form common
nitre. So much then for sal m'trum.
