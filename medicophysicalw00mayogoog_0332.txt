cartilage adbering to its interior, so that blood could
scarcely enter the ventricle. Indeed, there can be no
doubt that the obstruction ol the pulmonary vein
was the cause not only of the palpitation from which
the patient suffered, but also ol the above-mentioned
phenomena. For as the blood could not, on account
of the obstruction, pass into the left ventricle of the
beart, the pulmonary blood-vessels and also the right
ventricle were necessarily distended with blood. So,
too, the beart, and especially that ventricle, was
forced to contract violently so as to propel the mass
â€™ ol the blood as much as possible through the lungs
into the left ventricle of the beart. And this also
accounts for the great thickness and strength of the
right ventricle, since nruscles accustomed to more
violent exercise increase more than others. But that
the beart should have been dashed against the lef ,
side ol the chest with such violence that its ribs were
bent outwards, although it was the right ventricle of
the beart only that was swollen like a tumour, is to
be explained by what has been said above 5 for, indeed,
as the blood could not be all expelled from the right
ventricle because of the aforesaid obstruction, it,
compressed by the violent contractiori of the muscular
wall ol that ventricle, drove the septum of the beart
and so also the beart itsell to the lelt side, as we have
shown above.

It is also to be noted that palpitation of the beart,
such, namely, as occurs suddenly and unexpectedly,
may corne from this, that the blood, strongly
fermenting and set ln violent motion, rushes too
quickly into the ventricles of the beart, so that the
beart must needs contract with more than its usual
force to expel the greater quantity of blood. For it
must not be forgotten that the beart, like other
