the nerves originating in it; whence it comes about
that if the head of such animals is removed, the
influx of animal spirits into the spinal marrow is
altogether shut off, so that the parts of the decapi-
tated body at once collapse and are deprived of
animal motion. '

But in less perfect animals, such as insects, whose
cut-off parts live, the animal spirits are primarily and
immediately prepared, not only in the brain but also
in the protuberances of the spinal marrow, as it
were in so many cerebelli extended through the
whole length of the spinal marrow, or rather they are
stored as in suitable repositories; and hence it comes
to pass that in the cut-off portioris ol insects, the
animal spirits are supplied, for keeping up to some
extent life and motion, from the small piece of spinal
marrow connected with each portion.

But that the animal spirits should be brought into
the spinal marrow of insectS, it is most necessary that
some spiracula or bronchiae should be, as is the case,
continued into it, so that nitro-aerial particles, of
which animal spirits consist, should by their means be
carried into the spinal marrow. Hence, if any of the
said spiracula be smeared with oil, the neighbouring
parts, inasmuch as they are deprived of nitro-aerial
particles andos animal spirits, at once become para-
lysed, the remaining parts being meantime healthy;
while yet in perfect animals the nitro-aerial particles
are introduced into the blood only through the lungs,
and then, by the heart’s pulsation and the flow of
the blood, are carried to the brain and thence to
its spinal appendix. Hence it happens that if the
trachea is obstructed, and inspiration suppressed, or if
the motion of the heart and of the blood stops, or
even if the brain is disordered, the nitro-a'e'rial particles
