that it results from sulphureous exhalations carried
aloft and dispersed through the air; for that kind of
sulphureous matter can only become heated, or con-
tribute to the production oi heat, by first being kindled.
Therefore Ι think it should be held that the said
sultriness is not infrequently the result osa tremulous
and unequal movement of the air; for the air, when
agitated by a motion of that kind, becomes very warm
as the distinguished Descartes has remarked. For if
any one blows vigorously against the back of the hand
the breath is felt to be very cold; while, on the con-
trary, il he blows it into the contracted and bent palm
of the hand, it becomes not a little warm; the reason
seems to be that when the aerial particles are thrown
into a tremulous motion by being reflected hither and
thither in the hollow hand, it happens that the nitro-
aerial particles, by their striking against each other,
are gentlydetached andthrown into the motion that is
required for heat. But if a considerable tract of air is
at any time agitated by such a motion, it will not only
grow warm but will also be in a condition for entering
upon a motion of the kind required lor the production
of lightning.

As regards the wonderful violence with which
lightning sometimes overthrows and burns whatever
stands in its way, the distinguished Gassendi very in·
geniously supposes that glomeres (as he calls thern)
consisting of nitrous, vitriolic, and sulphureous ex-
halations, together with a small portion oi cloud
gathercd round them, descend to the earth, and that,
when they take fire at last, they burst into a very im·
petuous flame and destroy everything they come near.
But, indeed, not to say that nitrous or vitriolic vapours
do not exist in the air (asi endeavoured to show above),
it is scarcely probable that a small portion of cloud (if
