by itself for bringing the nitro-aerial spirits to the
brain in ample enough quantity: wherefore I consider
it likely that the thicker mem'nges which surrounds
the brain undergoes a sort of pulsation, and that by
its contractiori the blood driven to the braiu is
· compressed; and that thus the nitro-aerial particles
are pressed out of the mass of the blood, and driven
into the hrain, in a way not very unlike that in which
the other motive particles are forced into the motor
parts by the constriction of the muscles. Such a
pulse of the dura mater is confirmed by autopsy
itself : for, in fracture of the skull‚ part of the brain
comes into view, it is seen to rise in a tumour, and
immediately in turn to subside, which seems to be a
motion of the brain after the manner ol the heart’s
pulsation. F or, indeed, when I consider the thicknesS,
the strength, and the nervous fibres of the dura mater,
l can imagine nothing else than that that membrane,
like all the others, is intended for the productiori of
motion. For it is probable that the dura mater
behaves as another diaphragm by the help of which
the brain draws in nitro-aerial spirits and in a sense
breathes,

It is probable that the above described motion os
the menzizges is natural, but yet that we can at will
increase its pulsation, just as we can that of the parts
· which serve for respiration. And so by its diverse
motion various effects are produced in the bodies of
animals, as is probable. For according as that mern-
brane contracts itself more strongly or more weakly,
the nitro-aerial particles, i.e., the animal spirits, are
driven in greater or in less abundance into the brain
and thence into the nervous system. Hence if a
supply of animal spirits greater than usual is required
lor carrying on more intensely the motive or the
