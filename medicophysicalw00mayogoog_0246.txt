continuous supply of spirits and consequently an
uninterrupted movement of the heart, continuous
respiration is altogether necessary, since without it
the motion of the heart ceases.

Furthermore, if after the motion of the heart has
ceased from the stopping ol respiration, air is blown
in through a tube fitted to the vena cava, we shall see
the heart’s motion reestablished. So that it appears
that air is that without which the movements ol the
heart cannot go on at all. Nor does it matter much
how the air is transmitted to the mass ol the blood,
whether by the lungs or by any other way.

To this l add, lastly‚ that it is proved by Boyle’s
experiments that flies, bees, and other insects which
can move with half of their body after being cut
through the middle, can yet neither movenor live in
a place void of air. To these small animals that have
neither blood, nor hearts, nor lungs, at all events not
in their divided parts, air seems to be needed for no
other purpose except motion alone. Finally, accord-
ing to this hypothesis, it is easy to say whence the
beasts of burden that exercise nearly all their muscles
the whole day long, derive an adequate supply os
explosive material for so great an amount of work;
for what the entire mass of the blood is inadequate to

supply, the air, that freer fountain, can provide in
abundance.
