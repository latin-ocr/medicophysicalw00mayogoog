On Sal Ninum and Nitro-Atn‘al spirit 37

embrace. For it has been shown above that nitro·
aerial spirit is detained as in a suitable hospice in
fixed salt which has passed into the fluid state. But

when held in the embrace ol a salt and coalescing
with it, which is partly acid partly saline, to form
nitre, it exists in a condition ol the greatest fixity.

But meanwhile the terrestria} sulphur which, not
so long ago, wrapped in wedlock with fixed salt, was
fixed indeed, now, the saline yoke thrown off by help
of the nitro-aeria} spirit, attains a condition of vola· ·
tility and gets the mastery, the nitro-aerial spirit
being depressed. And in this way, in fine, extremely
volatile and inflammable sulphureous particles (such
as the oils which are obtained by distillation from
plants) are very likely produced from the rude mass
of the earth, which seems to behave like a. caput
mortuum. For the volatilisation of sulphur consists
in its being liberated from a union with fixed salt.
Auditis therefore clear that the fixation of sulphur
arises from its intimate union wilh a fixed salt. For
if sulphureous oils are combined with fixed salt, as is
the case in soap, they lose their inflammability alto-
gether. For soap, which is partly composed ol oil,
will not blaze if thrown into the fire.

When in this way nitro-aerial spirit, effervescing
obscurely with terrestria] matter, raises its sulphureous
part to the requisite volatility and coalesces also with
its saline part to form nitro, the elements ol natural
things are brought into the condition required lor·
the productior] of plants. For all plants seem to be
composed of terrestrial sulphur in a sufficiently volatile
and inflammable condition, and of nitro-aerial spirit
held in the embrace ol salt and subdued, that is to say
of nitrous salt, as will be shown presently.
