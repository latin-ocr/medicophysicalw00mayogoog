means oi which impulses and movements oi such kind
are kept up. Should¹ any one ask here what it is
which perpetually agitates that subtlematter,1answer
that it was set in motion when first created and that
’ there is nothing that can hinder its motion. For we
must imagine that it has no weight at all to stop
its motion, but that it is rather probable that the
weight oi bodies is ducto its impulse. Nor is this
subtle matter impeded in its motion by meeting with
other bodies, since it must be supposed so thiu, and
smooth‚ and solid as either to pass with ease through
the pores of bodies or to be reflected with its motion
unaffected when it' impinges upon their solid particles.
For it is impossible that this very subtle matter should
strike against any soit body. For softness implies a
great number of particles in a loose state of union,
but this matter is so fine that it cannot at a time
touch several particles, and socan only strike one,
and that is hard.

Let us then suppose that this subtle matter occupies
little spaces here and there interspersed among the
particles ol rigid bodies and sets up its motion of
circumgyration in these pores without hindrance of
any kind. For it is to be observed that the matter of
rigid bodies, oi whatever sort it be, was at one time
soit, tender‚ and to some extent fluid, so that the
subtle matter was able from the beginning to open
out little spaces in which to set up its motion. But
now when the rigid bodies are bent and their matter
suffers compression‚ the pores and little spaces ol the
bent rigid body are necessarily somewhat contracted,
so that the subtle matter is unable to describe its
circles in these now contracted little spaces, and there-
fore it strikes and impels any particles of the rigid
body which have been pushed into the spaces where
