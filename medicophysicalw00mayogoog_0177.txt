On Sal ll'z'trum and Nitro-Al‘rial Spr'rr't 141

some rays of light, in so far as it is polished in some
parts and fitted to reflect the rays of light. But it is
scarcely credible that the rays ol light are reflected
from a white surface in such abuudauce as is requisite
for producinga white colour all round. But the reason
why the said plane cannot be seen if it is highly
polished is to be looked for in what is said below.

Further, it appears that the luminous body itsell is
not seen by the rays of its own light, whether direct or
reflected. For a small lamp burning in a high place
can be seen clearly enough several miles off, far be·
yond the bounds of its illumination, by an eye in a
dark place. But this would not be if an image of it
were produced only by rays of its own light.

But to submit my own view on this question,I think
it is to be held as at least a probable conjecture that
the image ofa small lamp, seen beyond the limits of
its illumination, is propagated by a peculiar impulse
which is quite different from the impulse ol light.
Indeed igneo-nitrous particles when violently agitated
in a luminous body, in sofar as they strike and move
other nitro-aerial particles kindred with themselves
and these in their turn strike and move others, eon-
stitute the action of light, asI tried to show above;
but in so far as these igneous particles impel a peculiar
medium, distinct from, the luminous medium, and im-
press upon it a sort of special undulation or impulse,
they seem to diffuse in all directions a visible image
of themselves. For it is probable that particleS, igneous
and luminous per se, and with their own motion,
- do not affect so much the sense of sight as of touch.
For fiery particles cause very great pain, and the eye
when exposed to too fierce a light is injured as if it
were struck by some blow. Further, the solar rays
strike not only the eye but also the nostrils exposed
