muscles attached to it externally, but in the lower
part it is curved outwards by the powerful Psoas
muscles attached internally, as is shown in Plate IV.,
Fig. o, in which a, a is the spine, b the muscles
attached externally and bending the spine inwards in
its upper part, c the internal Psoas muscles bending
it outwards

And l think that this cause of curvature is not
confined to this disease, but acts also in other cases;
lor if in tender age a muscle should be emaciated
because of any defect of nutrition, it must follow
that it will bend the bone to which it is attached.

The thigh-bone and the humerus, where the muscles-
pull equally, being attached on all sides are rarely
beut to any side, being held in equilibrium: while
yet, as they cannot extend in length they must do
so in thickness, and even sometimes develop nodes.

5. It occurS, besideS, in this disease that the chest
is narrow and sharp: and this symptom can also
easily be illustrated on our hypothesis3 for the ribs
carniot expand their arches unless the intercostal
muscles are also increased, as can be seen in Plate
1V‚,Fig. 10, in which the portions of the ribs, a, a, a,
a, cannot be elongated unless the intercostal muscles
attached to them are similarly extended. But we
have assumed that the said muscles, inasmuch as
they are served by nerves derived from the spinal
marrow, cannot from defect of aliment be elongated,
so that the ribs cannot expand further and therefore
neither ean the chest, but the ribs are nourished, and

yet, impeded bythesaid muscles, cannot growin length ;
it folloim, therefore, that they must develop nodeS,
as they do. But this kind of growth does not corre·
spond to the abundance of nourishment, wherefore the
anterior extremities of the ribs are elongated into
