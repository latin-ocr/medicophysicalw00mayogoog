it descended to the earth in that way) could imprison
inflammable matter with force sufficient ior the stroke
of a thunderbolt.

Wherefore we may assume that the immense
force of lightning is produced in the following way.

For instance, ifa tower or other obstacle stands, at any
time, directly iu the path of the rush of air (for it is to
be observed that, in a thunderstorm, the air pressed
by the descending cloud spreads out one way or other),
it happens that the air is brought to a stand by
the opposition of the said things and is greatly con·
densed, as is shown in Plate 1.‚ F ig. 10. And not only
the a'erial particles but the sulphureous also, which
are raised into the air by the great heat of the sun, are
densely collected near the obstacle. But in conse·
quence of the dense collection of the particles of both
kinds, and their igniting in the manner aforesaid on
account of the violent concussion of the air, a globular
fire, and that very impetuous and rivalling gunpowder,
is produced. For it has been shown elsewhere that
the force of gunpowder is caused by nitro-aerial
particles bursting out in densest crowd from the
ignited nitre. Accordingly, since aerial particles are
charged with the s'ame nitro-aerial particles, if they
ignite when densely collected, the flame produced by
them will be very impetuous for the very same reason
as in the case oi gunpowder ; so that now it is no
wonder that a thunderbolt sometimes overwhelms
and prostrates whatever it meets.

In what has been said, we must look for the reason
why a thunderbolt sometimes melts a sword, while
the sheath is left intact. No doubt, since the motion
of the air excited in thunder shakes even solid bodies,
it sometimes happens that iron and other solid bodies
against which the force of that motion is specially
