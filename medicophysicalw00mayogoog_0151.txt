the glass first described has been placed. And let the
orifice 01 the glass in which the air is, be placed in
the orifice of the other glass filled with water, as is
seen in Plate V., Fig. 5 (0010 being taken that the
mouth of neither 01 the glasses is raised above the
surface of the water), and let the glass be inclined
until the air contained in it escapes and ascends into
the other glass, which can in this way be filled with
that air, although it is enough that a little of the air
be introduced into it.

And now the glass into which the air is transferred
in this manner, is to be enclosed in another glass from
which the air may afterwards be pumped by Boyle’s
air-pump, which may be done in this way. Let 0
vessel, not 100 10180, but capable 01 admitting the
orifice 01 the glass in which the air has now been
collected, be put under it, and then let this vessel
filled with water be removed, with the other glass
inverted and resting upon it, and be put inside the glass
110111 which the air is 10 be pumped out. After the
air has been partly exhausted, the air enclosed in the
said glass will expand beyond the cavity of the glass,
and most 0111 will escape through the underlying
water. When the air has been removed as far as
possible by the pump, let it be permitted to enter
anew. When this is done the water in contact with
the glass in which the aforesaid air is, will be driven
up into it 011 account of the pressure 01 the atmo-
sphere and will almost entirely fill it. For the air
which was left in that glass will occupy onlya part
of the narrower glass; and yet that small portion of
air,a moment ago, when the pressure of the sur-v
rounding air was almost withdrawn, occupied the'
whole glass, and was able to resist the pressure of the
surrounding water, and also of the air which 'could
