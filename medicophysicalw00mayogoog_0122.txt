On Sal Nitrum and ll'itro-At'rial spirit 85

quite unfit to sustain lile and flamell But then you will
say that the air enclosed in the glasses is still possessed
of sufficient elastic force to resist the pressure ol the
atmosphere‚ so that it would seem not to have been
deprived of its nitro-aerial and elastic particles. And
how then can it be that an animal ora lamp cannot
be sustained by it? Nay, Ι have ascertained that the
air in which an animal or a lamp has expired is
possessed ol no less elastic force than any other air,
for when the pressure ol the atmosphere is removed
it expands with no less vigour than common air,
as will be shown in Chapter X. But this seems
fiatly to contradict what hasbeen said on this matter.
The ‘answer to be given to this difficulty is, l think,
that the elastic force ol the air referred to does not
result lrom the elasticity ol its adrial particles being as
intense as that ol unaltered air, but rather from this,
that as aerial particles when deprived of nitro-aerial
particles become less rigid, so they are also more bcnt
by the pressure ol the atmosphere 3 but a weaker rigid
body, provided it has been greatly bent and stretched
will have no less elastic lorce than a stronger rigid
body less bent by the very same force. lt should be
also noted that the elastic force ol the said air results
in part also from this, that as that air deprived ol
elastic particles is reduced to narrower space, aerial
particles in air ol this sort are aggregated in greater
abundance and more densely than in common air.
Here we remark in passing that il the elastic lorce
of the air resulted lrom certain agile particles inter-
spersed in it, and il these were exhausted by the
breathing ol the animal or the burning ol tho lamp,

' then air in which an animal or a lamp hasbeen enclosed

would by no means expand with as much force as
unaltered air. So that even by this it is clearly proved
