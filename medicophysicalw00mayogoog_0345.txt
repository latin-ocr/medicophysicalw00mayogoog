On Rickets 309

muscles do not grow in the same proportion as the
viscera.

3. Further, the mesentery is affected with enlarged
glandsand strumous tumours. That the cause of

this symptom may be better understood, I shall
· shortly explain the origin of glands. The nervous
juice when mixed with blood in due fermentation,
passes into nutritive and fleshy substance; but if
the nerve, replete and turgid, pours out its juice,
which is very like white of egg, into the interstices
of the flesh, the matter so poured out does not uow
produce flesh, lor wantos the blood required lor this,
but is coagulated into a glandular body very like
itself, as is shown by observation. For when l have
been about to make some experiment on a dog, l
have wounded a nerve: on this occurring, the dog
is painfully racked with convulsions: on dissection
after about three months, I found a pretty large
glandulas concretion at the place where the wound
had been inflicted, and this secmed to have its origin
from the nervous juice escaping from the puncture
ol the nerve. This being assumed, we see that when
the nervous juice is transferred from the replete
brain to the abdomen, by the before-mentioned vagus
and intercostal nerves, in such quantity that it cannot
be transformed into the substance of the viscera, that
juice is deposited in the interstices of the membranes,
of which there are many, and there gives rise to
numerous strumous swellings And not in the
abdomen only, but wherever there are nerves arising
from the brain and turgid with that juice, there
strumous tumours may be seen: but these disappear
soon alter the disease is sured, for the nervous juice
which was poured out in such abundance from the
hrain, by the nerves thence arising, and produced the
