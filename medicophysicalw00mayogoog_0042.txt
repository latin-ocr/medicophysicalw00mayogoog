part consists, is derived from the earth-and for this
reason, that it cannot, as we have already indicated,
reside in the very rare airon account of its highly
fixed nature. It favours this view that lrom earth
impregnated with fixed or volatile salt, as from stables
and also from soil containing quicklime or ashes, sal
nitrum is lixiviated in greater abundance than from
any other soil, because these salts‚ united in course of
time with nitro-airial spirit in a way tube explained
below, are converted into nitre, And, indeed, it is
probable that ashes, quicklime‚ and the like, fertilise
the soil, for this reason only, that they afford fixed
salt for the production of nitre, as will be shown
below,

Here, perhaps, some one will object that if earth
from which all the salts have been lixiviated is ex·
posed to the air, sal nitrum will, after some time, be
produced in it anew.

I reply that seeds of fixed salts exist, although
obscurely, in all soil, even in that which has been
lixiviated, and that these, by the force of a sort oi
aerial ferment, are digested in course of time into
fixed salt, as 1 shall endeavour to show below. That
the earth is impregnated with a certain universal seed,
fecundating all things, has long been a received
opinion. Why, then, not suppose that this macro-
cosmic seed is either itself fixed salt or, at least, the
seeds ο1 fixed salts hidden in the bosom ο1 the earth ;
and that these when brought in progress of time to
· maturity are, together with nitro-aerial spirit, changed
intosal nitrum. And it is a prool ol this that nitre
generated in the bowels ol the earth contributes in no
small degree to the growth ο1 plants, as will be shown
below. For as metallic seeds here and there dispersed
through the mass ο1 the earth are in the course of
