come to the top of the a'e'rial vortex, they, receding
from the centre of their spiral motion, are dispersed all
around, and, heaped up in great abundance, form the
dense and gloomy cloud widely spread lor a short time
(d, d). This, after the motion of the vapours of which
it consists has ceased, breaks up in a storm ol rain, and,
pressing by its weight on the underlying air and push-
ing it out, causes the violent wind. But it is to be
observed that although at some distance from the
aforesaid mass of waters‚ boisterous winds blow and
the sea is very rough, yet near the phenomenon allis
calm, which 1 think may thus be explained. Since the
air is very dense at the outer edge ol the vortex, as is
seen in the figure, and is thrust out all round from the
aerial vortex by the pressure of the superincumbent
cloud, the winds carried towards the vortex are arrested
and turned back by the air, which is very dense and also
rushes in the opposite direction, so that their impulse
cannot reach the vortex, yet meanwhile these winds
driven backwards cause furious whirlwinds at some
distance from the said phenomenon.

It also makes for this, that the sea near the column
of rising water is whirled round—a motion in water
very much opposed to the propagation of waves‚ which
advance only in straight lines.

After the mass ol water has again fallen,a certain
part of the said tube is usually broken off, and when
this happens avast quantity ol water descends lrom on
high, and if a ship happens to be under it she is in·
stantly overwhelmed and sunlr. There can be no
doubt that the water is produced hythe condensation
and collection of the vapours which have risen in the
tube. But such a heaping up ol them comes from this
that when the motion of the adrial whirlwind has
apaten, the vapours at the top of the tube, ceasing
