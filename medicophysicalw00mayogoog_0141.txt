abounds with them) effervescing with the saline·
sulphureous particles of the aforesaid liquid seem to
cause the scarlet colour which rivals that of arterial
blood. For it is the nature os nitro-aerial particles
when set in motion to produce a ruddy colour in the
substances in which they are, as happens in spirit of
nitre, which is ruddy during distillation.

It is to be noted here that as nitro-a'e'rial particles
cause the fermentation ol the blood, so this fermenta·
tion strikes out, in the way shown above, and draws
from the air other nitro-aerial particles by which fer·
mentation goes on anew in the blood. In fact nitro-
aerial spirits, when mixed with the mass of the blood
in the lungs, produce an intense enough effervescence
in it; but they are soon separated for the most part
from the blood in the system of the body, for purposes
to be explained below, so that the fermentation of
the blood on its return to the lungs is for want of
thern much diminished and more sluggish; but still
it does not cease so completely as to be unable to
draw nitro-aerial particles from the air for its renewal.
And so in fine the movement ol fermentation is per·
petuated in the animal Automaton.

Just as the fermentation ol the blood, so also its
heat arisesI think from the effervescence of nitro-a'e'rial
particles with the saline-sulphureous particles of the
blood. For if any saline-sulphureous minerals, such
as the vitriolic Marchasites and the like, be exposed,
when recently dug up, to moist air, they will shortly
effervesce and become intensely hot, inasmuch as
aerial particles give rise to a very pronounced efferves-
cence when they meet with the saline-sulphureous

particles of the mineral. Further all substances, at
least those which are endowed with some degree ol con·
‹ sistency, grow somewhat warm while fermenting-a
