the solar rays, is considerably increased in weight,
as has been ascertained by experiment. Indeed, we
cau scarcely imagine any other source lor this increase
of the antimony than the nitro-aerial and igneous
particles fixed in it during calcination.

I am aware that it is the common opinion that
the diaphoretic virtue of antimony is due to the
loss of its extraneous and combustiblc sulphur in its
calcination. But I am not sure that this view is
quite consistent with truth. For it is well known
. that if antimony and nitre are mixed and thrown
into a heated crucible, a very impetuous flamc will
arise from them, since the sulphur of the antimony
ignites the nitre mixed with it. ll, however, the
antimony has detonated (as the chemists phrase
it) with about a double quantity of nitre, then
nitre mixed with it will no longer produce a flamc,
since the combustible sulphur ol the antimony has
been entirely removed in the first detonation. And
still the antimony has not yet acquired the diapho-
retic virtue. Hence, for its further fixation, charcoal
or some sulphureous matter should be put from time
to time into the crucible in which the antimony,
along with the nitre last added to it, has been fused,
so that the nitre may ignite and the antimony be
fixed by its long-enduring flame. Clearly, then, the
fixation of antimony appears to be caused, not so
much by the removal of its extraneous sulphur, as

by the fixation in it of the nitro-aerial particles in
which the flame of nitre abounds.

, The >reason why an addition of tartar to nitre
contributes greatly to the fixation of antimony is Ἴ
obvious from what has been said. For Ι think it
must be attributed to the tartar being imbued with
such sulphur as is suitable for gradually and thoroughly
