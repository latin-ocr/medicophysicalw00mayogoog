nature of light, let us make a brief investigation of
the quality of the colours which are produced by light.

With regard to colours and the visible forms of
things, it is the most generally received opinion that
they are produced by the rays of light reflected in
various ways. But indeed I am not sure that this
way of explaining colours is quite in accordance with
truth. For let us suppose that a lamp is placed out·
side a chamber so that the rays of light, by means
of two apertures made in opposite walls of the chamber,
may pass through the intervening space. When this
isdone, if the eye be placed in any part of the chamber
except that through which the bundle of rays passos,
the chamber will appear completely dark and the rays
ol light passing through it will not be seen at all. But
now, let us suppose any coloured plane b, Plate 1.,
Fig. 11, to be placed obliquely to the rays passing thus
through the chamber 3 when this is done, the plane will
be illuminated and by an eye placed at a will be seen
ol some colour, suppose white ; and yet it seems that
the rays of light are not reflected to the said eye. For
il that plane is polished in the manner of a mirror and
suitable ior the reflection of rays of light, the rays
falling upon it will, from its oblique position, be
diverted from the eye and reflected to the opposite
side of the chamber, towards c, to which the line of
reflection tends. One would naturally say that a
coloured surface, especially a white one, has little
swellings or molecules most densely crowded upon it,
whose innumerable very small suriaces look in all
directions around; and that the rays of light falling
upon these very small suriaces, which are turned
towards the eye wherever it is situated, are reflected
by them, as by so many mirrors, to the eye, and im-
press upon it the sense of colour. And hence it is that
