presently be precipitated w'ith fetid odour. For
although already in the slaking of the lime the
alkaline salt ol the lime has united with its aeid, not
without effervescence and a quite notable heat, yet it
will nevetheless immediately desert the aeid betrothed
to it to be married in closer wedlock with the vitriolic
aeid, by which however its pow'ers are so completely
overcome that the alkaline saltos the lime combined
with the vitriolic acid is no longer able as before to
dissolve sulphur; but that a fixed salt is combined
withan acid salt in the water in which quicklime has
been slaked, and further that the heat ol that water is
caused by the union ol contrary salts, will be made
still clearer by what is to be said below.

Since the contrary salts in the water in which
quicklime has been slaked are but little fit lor entering
into a very close union and ior mutually destroying
each others powers, each oi them consequently can
perform the operations appropriate to its own nature.
And this is seen clearly in sal armoniae, in which the
acid salt is combined with a volatile salt, and yet that
aeid salt is not so completely subdued by its unequal
adversary, the volatile salt united with it, as to be
unable to dissolve iron as acids do and to change it
into vitriol. Yet if any fixed salt contends with the
aeid armoniae salt, then indeed its strength is com-
pletely destroyed so that it is quite incapable ol dis·
solving iron any longer. And the case in fact seems
to be similar in water ol quicklime, for here the less
opposing salts do not so completely destroy each
other but that either of them can act according to its
nature. For the fixed salt ol that water is able to
dissolve sulphur, and its aeid salt can fix and destroy
volatile salts‚ as was said above.

With respect to water which has slaked quicklime,
