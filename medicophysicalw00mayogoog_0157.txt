is nature’s way to produce all the greatest things by
means ol the least, for how small and delicate are
those spirituous particles which set the huge machinery·
os the elephant in truly stupendous motion? And
what is to be said of the very small particles of
insects? For as their whole bulk is merely a point in
appearance, how minute must those portions be which
we cannot suppose to be one-thousandth part of the·
whole? Indeed I make bold to affirm that natural
movements of this kind are effected by particles too
minute for human discernment.

It is to be concluded from the foregoing that the
ignited particles in the burning of fire are'agitated
with elastic impulse, for just as we have shown above
that the power ol recoil iubent rigid bodies is due 'to
thepulsation of subtle matter, so also we maintain that
the motion of ignited particles results from impactos
the same matter. Indeed the burning of fire does not
seem to be very different frorn the bending to fracture
of any rigid body, or rather of the aforementioned
glass drops. For as in bent rigid bodies, their particles,
thrust within the circles of the subtle matter, are
struck by it, and at last, ir the rigid body is bent to·
breaking, are violently driven out, so in fire the
sulphureous and nitro-aerial particles, when they enter
