T ΗΕ experimenta of Boyle have proved beyond doubt
that air is eminently elastic and therefore spreads and
expands immensely when relieved from the pressure
of the atmosphere. But it is not so clear to what
cause the elastic force of the air is due. Ι shall, how-
ever, state briefly the result of my reflections on this
recondite subject.

In the first place, then, Ι take it for granted that the
air contains certain particles termed by us elsewhere
nitro-aerial which are absolutely indispensable lor the

productiori of fire, and that these in the burning of
flame are drawn from the air and removed, so that the
latter when deprived of these particles ceases to bc fn
for supporting fire, as has been shown above.

It must also be admitted that the elastic force ol the
air is due to the same ae'rial particles as those hy
which flame is supported—an inference which we
deduce from the fact that air deprived of these nitro-
ae'rial particles loses elastic force, as will be established
by what follows

For firstly we have to note, what almost everybody
ltnowa that if a cupping-glass filled with flanre be
applied to the shin, the dame will soon go out and the
space within the cupping·glass will be almost empty,
