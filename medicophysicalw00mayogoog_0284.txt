nitre, as iar as its saline and aeid part is concerned, is
in any way opposed to the sulphureous particles of
the wine.

For, no doubt, just as the nitro-abrial spirit meeting
with terrestrial sulphur excites that fermentation in
which the motion and the life ol vegetables consist,

so also according as the same spirit, brought by means
ol respiration into the mass ol the blood and there
effervescing with the saline-sulphureous particles of
the blood, produces the vital heat and motion, as 1
have elsewhere striven to show, it is probable that
animal lile and the motive fonction are brought about
by the same particles more exalted and put in a
condition of the highest vigour. For indeed I think
that the rritro-a'e'rial particles springing forth from the
brain into the motor parts effervesce there with
the saline-sulphureous particles meeting them, and
muscular contractiori is caused by their mutual agita·
tion in the way to be stated below. And hence it is
that lor keeping up animal motion it is essentially
necessary that there should never be a deficiency in
the mass ol the blood ol saline-sulphureous pabulum or
of nitro-aerial particles; and by how much more
intensely the muscular contraction takes place, as in
the harder kinds ol work, so much greater is the outlay
ol nitro-a'e'rial and of sulphureous particles, lor the
repair ol which not only is the respiration increased,
but besides there must be taken in greater quantity
food filled with saline-sulphureous particles. Hence
those articles of food which contain abundauce ol
volatile salt and sulphur are specially fitted for restor-
ing the powers worn by long-continued labour.

From what has been said, we may seek the reason
why so intense a heat is excited in the motor parts by
violent exercise. That heating is commonly attri-
