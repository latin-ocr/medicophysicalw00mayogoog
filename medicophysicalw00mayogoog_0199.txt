On Sal Nr'trram and Miro-Amal Spirit 163

metals allied to it that sulphur seeks lor union, yet
in such wise that the metals, like the alkaline salt,
will at once leave it to form a more intimate union
with an aeid poured upon it. For if an aeid liquid
such as aqua fortis be poured upon a rnetal rich in
sulphur, say antimony‚ and then the mixture be
heated, the sulphur will be sublimed to a considerable

extent, since the aeid salt ol the liquid uniting with
the metal expels its sulphur frorn its lodgment.

Lastly, as metals leave their own sulphur that they
may combine with an aeid salt, so sulphur will quit
metals with which it is united, to coalesce in a closer
union with a fixed salt. For il a metal abounding in
sulphur, such as stibium, be boiled in strong lye, the

metallic sulphur will dissolve in it, since the sulphur
seeks to be united with the fixed salt ol the lye rather
than with the rnetal ; but this metallic sulphur will be
precipitated also from the fixed salt, if an acid salt is
poured upon it.

It is also to be noticed here that although sulphur,
like an aeid salt, can combine with an alkaline salt
and with metals, and can be precipitated lrorn them,
we must not therefore suppose that a certain acid
salt (such as the Oleum Sulphuris par Campanam)
lies hidden in a mass of sulphur, and that by its
intervention the alkaline salt unites with the sulphur.
For if alkaline salt and sulphur united together (as
inliver ol sulphur) be dissolved in water, and the
aeid oil of sulphur be then added, the sulphur im·
mediately thrust out lrorn its union with the fixed
salt will be precipitated. And yet, if the combina-
tion of the sulphur with the fixed salt resulted from
this, namely, that the aeid salt contained in the sulphur
unites with the alkaline salt, then the pouring of that
aeid or oil ol sulphur upon them when combined with
