particles are fixed in it and are firmly detained in its
structure which is even harder after calcination than
before, and that afterwards these particles, driven
out of their quarters by the water poured on the lime,
burst forth and by their motion produce heat. But
indeed it seems to me scarcely probable that igneous
particles are fixed in quicklime in this way, for its
structure seems to be too loose to detain the extremely
agile nitro-aerial particles. But even supposing igneous
particles to exist in quicklime, how should the pouring
of water upon it rouse them to the motion requisite
for heat? For aqueous particles are of a nature to
arrest the motion ol igneous particles and to extinguish
them, but not to throw thern into motion.

Wherefore we are at liberty to suppose that nitro·
aerial and igneous particles exist in quicklime, not
simply and by themselves, but closely combined
with some salt, and that the heat which arises when
water is sprinkled upon it is due to the existence in
it of contrary salts—an aeid, to wit, and an alkali-
and to their action upon each other.

For, first, we must hold that a fixed salt is contained
in quicklime. For if quicklime is thrown upon an
acid liquid, such as water with which oil ol vitriol has
been mixed, the water will presently be deprived of all
its acidity, since the lixed salt of the lime immediately
absorbs and destroys the acid salt of the vitriol, being
contrary to it.

F urther, if spirit ol vitriol be poured upon quick-
lime slaked by pouring water on it and not yet quite
dry, heat and a pretty brisk fermentation will result
from their action upon each other-a clear proof that
an alkaline salt exists in quicklime. For in this case
the heat in the previously slaked lime does not arise
from the moisture ol the vitriolic spirit but from the
