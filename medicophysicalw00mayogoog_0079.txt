asleep in the bosom ol the fixed salt, and mindful

as it were of former wrongs, thrust it forth frorn its
saline shelter and set it in moti0n; but the nitro-
ae'rial spirit, when violently torn from its saline
partner, throws everything into disorder by its im·
petuous motion and loosens the union of the corn·
pound. But in order that what has been said may
be better understood, let us consider in how many
ways things rush to their destruction, for in all
these we shall find that internal movement is caused
by sulphureous particles and nitro-a'e'rial spirit whether
the latter is derived from without or not.

In the first place, the mode in which the structure
ol things is most speedily dissolved is Fire. But this
is nothing else than an exceedingly impetuous fer-
mentation oi nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles in
mutual agitation, as has been shown above. Thus,
in combustion, sulphureous particles, moving with
extreme velocity, throw into a most violent and
fiery motion the nitro-aerial particles which exist
in a state of fixation. This is evident when nitre is
burned, lor in its burning, nitro-aerial particles which

were previously fixed and inert in the embrace oi ,

the fixed salt, are thrown into fiery motion by the
agency of the sulphureous particles. And indeed
it is probable that even the nitro-a'e'rial particles of
the air are ina fixed state previous to their being
roused into fiery motion, as I shall endeavour to
show elsewhere.

As the destructive power of fire is due to nitro-
ae'rial particles, so also every internal movement
which things undergo seems to depend upon a
less violent agitation ol the same particles. And
it is a proof of this that in putrefaction and in
nearly all fermentative movements some heat is
