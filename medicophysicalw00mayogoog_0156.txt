in fiery motion, agitate with their own velocity very
many others, and these in their turn others of the
*same mass3 so that indeed the smallest spark is
sufficient to cause a wide conflagration, which, yet, is
entirelycontrary tothe ordinarylaws of nature. For in
other cases when one body in motion impels and mores
another at rest, the motion in both is diminished.
Fora moving body which strikes another body and
rnoves it from its place, loses as much of its own
motion as it communicates to the other, so that
when afew particles set in motion a large number ol
the same mass, the motion in each will be greatly
diminished.

That the burning particles in lire, then, should in-
crease their motions to such an extent, it seems to me
necessary that some other moving body should be
added to the ignited particles, to promote and intensily
their motion. And I think this is how it occurs. It
is no doubt probable that sulphureous particles when
divided most minutely, and violently agitated by the
application ol lire or in any other way, impinge upon
the nitro-aerial particles residing in the particles of the
air, or of common nitre, and drive them into those
small spaces in which the subtle matter revolves with
swiltest motion (as we showed above), but that the
nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles, when driven
within the spherules which are described by that re-
volving matter, are driven further and forced out by it
with their motions greatly increased, and that at last
the nitro-adria] particles, on being violently sundered
in this way from the fixed salt ol nitre, or from the
aerial particles with which they were previously most
firmly united, are thrown into a truly fiery motion.
Assuredly we must suppose that the sulphureous and
nitro-aerial particles, and also the subtle matter, are
