tribute to the strength of the muscles and to the
more effective performance ol their pull. Certainly
the fibrils‚ whether we consider their number, their
size, or their position, would seem much more fit for
bringing about muscular contractiori than the fleshy
fibres. And this is further much confirmed by actual
inspection; lor, so iar as I have ever been able to
attain in examination by vivisectionS, the fleshy libres,
in the contractior] of a muscle, as if attracted by the
transverse fibriis, seemed to come nearer one another,
and not to be themselves shortened, but to follow the
contractiori ol the fibrils.

As to the fact that, in consequence ol a· ligature
being tied round each end ol the lleshy fibres,
muscular contraction ceases and the fibre itself does
not, as it otherwise would, swell up, as has been noted
by the eminent Dr Willis, I think this due to the
interruption, by means of the ligatures, ol the motion
of the blood and of the animal spirits, an inflow ol
which is necessary for the contraction of the librils.
