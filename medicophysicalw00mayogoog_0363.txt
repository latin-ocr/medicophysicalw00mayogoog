produced: although sometimes purgation and also
vomiting (which when gently brought on has proved

very serviceable) may be used. If the tooth is about
to pierce the gum, nurses are used to rub it with a
stick of polished coral: instead oi that, the root of
Althea or of Lapathus acutus may be used. It is even
sometimes right to make a way lor the coming tooth
by means of an incision. Also epispastic plasters
behind the ears bring relief. Yet if pain and sleep-
lessness call for hypnotics, syrup of poppies may be
given in a dose ol one to two drachms.

Besides internal medicines and surgical care, external
appliances will also be employed. Among these
are to be reckoned exercises of all kinds. Il the
strength permits it, walking is much to be used.
But often the children play sitting, and are exercised
by being carried on the nurses' arms and by being
rocked in the cradle. For exercise promotes the flow
of blood and of animal spirits also to the muscular
parts, and thus heat is produced in these enleebled
parts, as the mass of the blood is forced into swilter
motion by the contraction ol the muscles, and is
impregnated with fermentativc particles in the lungs
by the respiration made more intense by the exercise ;
while on the other hand the blood becomes thick
by constant repose and is made litter for producing
obstructions.

F urther, rubbings are ol no small moment in curing
this disease: they may be made with warrn woollen
cloths. The parts to be rubbed are the spine, which,
as hasbeen shown above, is primarily at fault; also
the muscular parts, yet with this caution, that there is
to be no rubbing where the bones are prominent, but
the concave parts ol the bones are to be more liberally
rubbed: the reason for this has been given above.
