96 Mayow

So that clearly we must conclude that the air con·
tained in the glass has its clastic force diminished by
about one-fourth part, in consequence 01 the said
action produced by the spirit 01 111113 encountering

the iron. Hence it is unable to make the same resist-
ance 35 previously to the pressure 01 the atmosphere,
and consequently the water underneath is impelled
upwards into the glass.

Further, after the vapours in the said glass have
been as 131 35 possible condensed and the water inside
does not rise any higher, let its height ⁴be indicated as
before by pieces 01 paper. Then let the iron be
lowered a second time into the vessel containing the
spirit 01 111113, that action may be excited anew. But
that this may the better succeed, an ample supply of
spirit 01 111113 ought to be put into the vessel, or
rathertwovesselscontainingspirit ofnitre, andalso two
small portions 01 11011, should be suspended in the glass,
When the water sinks anew about five finger-breadths
in consequence 01 the vaponrs produced, let the iron
as before be taken out 01 the vessel, and when this is
done the water will gradually rise in the glass, yet not so
quickly nor so 131 35 the first time. For the water
which rose 31131 the first action about six finger·
breadths, audiar indeed above the height first marked,
will only rise 31131 the second, even should it be more
intense, some two finger-breadths more or less. Nay,
it will never rise to the mark from which it fell. 11 the
action be repeated a third time the result will be just
the same as in the second,

Now it seems extraordinary that the water which,
aiter the effervescence first excited, was raised 131 above
the height from which it sank, should aiter the second
action, though brought about in the very same way,
not even recover its former height. For what are
