aqueous particles has been placed beyond all doubt
by Boyle's experiments; for if spring or rain-water
be put in a glass from which the air is exhausted by
motion, innumerable little bubbles, formed of the
substance of air, will burst from it. In fact, as soon
as the pressure 01 the atmosphere is almost removed,
the aerial particles dispersed through the mass of the
water immediately open and stretch out in virtue of
their elastic force; so that the little portions of air
which previously lay hidden and quite inconspicuous
in the pores 01 the water, now swell into little bubbles
which are forced upprards on account 01 their lightness.
Moreover‚ that air resides in the small pores of water
will be further proved by the following experiment.
For let asmall glass be placed in such away under
water contained in a suitable vessel, that all the air
may escape from it and water enter in its place
Then let that glass, filled with water, be inverted and
placed at the bottom 01 the said vessel, and let it
remain so, much as in Plate V., Fig. 3. After these
preparations‚ let the vessel into which the inverted
81555 15 put be placed on the frre so that the water
contained in it may be heated, and then let the vessel
be removed from the lire so that the water may again
cool. When this is done, we shall find that the top
01 the inverted glass is occupied by a kind of air
partly composed 01 the vapours raised from the
boiled water and not yet completely condensed‚ but
partly 01 adrial matter. For since the air mixed with
the water contained in the glass is rarefied hythe
heat of the fire, and consequently occupies more space
than formerly, it is raised in the form of little bubbles
to the top 01 the 81555 by the pressure 01 the
surrounding water. And that this aerial matter isin
part air, I infer also from this, that 5 certain portion
