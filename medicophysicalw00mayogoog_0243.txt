indeed because of an explosion (for of course there is
no such thing in this case) but because the ventricles
actually contract. And further it is obvious that the
movement of the heart is not caused by the rarefaction
of the blood, because hearts are sometimes observed to
beat after being cut out even if the blood has been
pressed out of their ventricles. Indeed, if a solution
of opium or cold water be injected through the
jugular vein, the beating of the heart will immediately
become more frequent, as Ι have often observed; but
this cannot be caused by a more frequent heating, for
heating is greatly hindered by substances of that
kind. '

So that obviously the heart seems to be nothing
but a muscle, differing but little in its action from
other muscles,and we must believe its function to con·
sist in contractiori alone and the expulsion of the
blood. ,

But although nitro-aerial particles excite fermenta-
tion in the mass of the blood, Ι do not know whether
it is owing to the want of them that the blood,
immediately upon respiration being checked, becomes
so thick that it is quite incapable ol motion, and
stagnates in the left ventricle of the heart. For the
blood while not yet impregnated with air is sent
readily enough from the right ventricle, and indeed
the left ventricle differs from the right in no other
'respect than in the greater power it possesses ol
driving¹ out the blood even if it be thicker. And yet
it is not to be denied that nitro-adrial particles
conduce not a little to the fermentation and, conse-
quently, also to the fluidity of the blood, as was said
elsewhere. But, you will ask, how is it then thar
death follows so soon upon breathing being arrested
if the blood is not rendered incapable of motion?
