even when they move with the swiftest and most
fiery motion. How much less then will sulphureous ·
particles‚ which seem to be grosser than nitro-adrial
spirit, penetrate such bodies in an instant?

l may therefore maintain with the distinguished
Descartes that light consists in motion or impulse
alone, which, because of the continuity of the lumi-
nous medium, is transmitted to the greatest dis-
tance without any delay. For certainly impulse or
motion is eminently adapted to the laws which are
followed in the propagation of light. For the nature
of impulse is such that it will promptly cease when
the impelling force is withdrawn, and it advances only
in straight lines. Further the force of impulse is
propagated instantaneously to the greatest distances
through solid bodies. For the ease here, owing to
the continuity of the medium, is just as if one end of
arod being moved, the blow impressed on it were
transmitted almost instantaneously to the other very
remote end.

As to the medium by the impulse of which the
rays of light are transmitted‚ it is not to be believed
that it is air itself‚ since light can be propagated very
intensely even in a glass vessel containing no air.
And therefore it is probable that besides the nitro·
aerial particles fixed in the aeria] particles, other nitro·
aerial particles are interspersed among them and fill
all their interstices; which we infer from this, that
solar says, if collected by means of a burning-glass,
actually ignite even in a glass from which the air is ex·
hausted. For gunpowdercan be ignited by them there,
and sulphureous matter ean also be sublimed by their
heat ; but I have already attempted to show that heat
and fire do not arise except from nitro-aerial particles
set in motion. Thus it would seem that even in a
