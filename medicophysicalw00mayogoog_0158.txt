the minute pores of the air or ol nitre itsell, and are
impelled there into the spherules of the subtle matter,
produce the same effect in the aerial particles, or on
anything else impregnated with nitro-aerial particles,
as il, like rigid bodies, they were bent to breaking: so
that the igneonitrous particles would appear to burst
forth with elastic impetus from the air, not otherwise
than the small bits ol glass from the fractured glass.
Itis a corroboration of this view that aerial particles
and the particles of nitre itself, in which, namely, igneo·
nitrous spirit especially resides, become still like rigid
bodies and are imbued with elasticity, and are con·
sequently of a sort fit for having igneous particles shot
out ol them with elastic impetus.

It would be easy to show here that nearly all natural
movements, such as the generation and dissolution
of things and the internal motions ol opposed liquids,
are, similarly, to some extent due to the battering ol
the subtle matter. It is probable indeed that these
motions are excited in the same way as fire is kindled 3
lor fire appears to be nothing but the most intense
fermentation of nitro-aerini and sulphureous particles.
lt certainly does not seem to be sufficient to say with
the eminent Willis in regard to these natural motions,
that the more active particles expand, ascend, and
finally fly away ; for, in a discussion of this sort, what
should specially be shown is why particles at rest
begin to move, for whatever is at rest will remain
lor ever at rest, if it is not set in motion by some
cause. With respect to motion of this kind, it appears

to me necessary to suppose some perpetually nroving
matter by the impulse of which these motions are

effected. As then the very rapid motion of fiery par-
ticles seems to proceed from this, that the sulphureous
particles coming up to the particles of nitre or of air
