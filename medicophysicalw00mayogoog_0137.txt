and fermentiag there. gradually rub its particles and
diminish their clastic force. Hence if the vapours
produced by any action are of such a sort as cannot
last a good while in the air, the water will only ascend
into the space left by thern on their contractiora by
condensation. If therefore they are of such a kind
that they do not undergo notable condensation, the
water in the said glass will not rise above the limit
first marked. Whenever,l say, the vapours generated
will occupy more space than is left by the impaired air,
then, however much the elastic force of the air is
diminished, it will not be observed in the said glass.
And hence it is that if action is causedin the glass by
spirit ο1 nitre and a fixed salt being mixed, as also by oil
of vitriol and iron acting on each other, in the manner
aforesaid, the water will not rise above its original level.

lt is to be noticed in passing that although the
exhalation produced by the spirit of nitre and iron,
when acting on one another, will never pass into a
liquid condition, as will be shown below, still it can
scarcely be thought that it is really air. For when the
fermentation was first produced in the aforesaid glass,
the air in it was lor the most part impaired—at least

as regards elastic force—as was previously pointed out ς
yet when the glass was almost filled with the exhala-
