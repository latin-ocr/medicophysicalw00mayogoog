place deprived ol air there are nitro-aerial particles,
aud that the fire produced there by the solar rays, con-
· centrated by means of a speculum, consists in this,

that the nitro-aerial particles are so much impelled
:at the point where the solar rays meet that they
are thrown into a really fiery motion. So that the
medium by whose impulse the rays of light are propa·
‚gated seems clearly to be nothing else than nitro·
aerial particles very densely distributed through the
atmosphere. Indeed it is probable that nitro-aerial
particles when moving in a luminous body witha
very rapid and fiery motion, communicate to the
other nitro-aerial particles, dispersed through the
-ether and of the same nature as themselves, the
peculiar impulse by which the rays of light are
propagated.

But you will say, if nitro-adria] particles exist in a
place void of air, why cannot a lamp be kindled and
burn there since no requisite is lacking for the pro-
duCtiou of flame. 1 answer that the sulphureous
particles of a lamp contribute in no way to produce
dame, except in so far as they strike out from adrial
particles, the uitro-adrial particles which, sundered with
violence, are thrown into fiery motion, as was pointed
-out above. But sulphureous matter seems to be ΒΥ
no means fir for throwing into fiery motion the nitro·
aeria] particles disseminated through the ether.

Like igneous particles, so also moving particles of all
substances whatsoever which give an impulse to the
luminous medium in the due way, are capable of pro-
ducing light. Hence it is that a kind of feeble light is
emitted by the glow·worm, ΒΥ rotten wood, and the
like.

Further that light is propagated ΒΥ the impulse of
nitro-aerial particles seems to be confirmed by its pass·
