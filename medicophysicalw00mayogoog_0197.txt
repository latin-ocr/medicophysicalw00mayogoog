On Sal Nitrum and Nalm-Adria! spirit 161

will be eoagulated with the fixed salt oi tartar, but the
volatile salt, oi which it also in part consists, ascends
oi the same nature as before. And the reason oi this
is, that the aeid spirit of salt is capable of entering
into closer union with any fixed salt than it is with
a volatile salt, so that it immediately leaves the volatile
salts that it may be combined more intimately with
the fixed salt. But ii oil of vitriol is united with salt of
tartar, they can scarcely be separated from each other.
And yet this is not because these salts have mutually
destroyed eaeh other, but because there is nothing in
nature with which either of them can unite more
firmly than they do with each other.

As acid salts leave volatile salts to form a closer
union with the fixed salt oi tartar, as being a more
suitable partner, so doubtless fixed salts select some
one acid in preference to others that they may com-
bine with it in a closer union.

But to illustrate this by an example: if oil oi vitriol

, is poured upon nitre, which consists of an alkaline

and oi a volatile acid salt (as was shown above), the
fixed saltos the nitre will soon leave its own aeid and
will enter into union with the acid of the vitriol, which
is more concordant with it; so that nitrous aeid,
on account of the mixture with the vitriolic acid, is
correetly said to be precipitated from the embraces oi
the alkaline salt. That the case is so, is clear, for
if nitre mixed with oil of vitriol be distilled‚ the
spirit or acid salt of the nitre will pass under a mild
heat into the receiving vessel, while yet in other
circumstances that spirit will not be earried up except
by a very vehement fire. No doubt it is because the
volatile acid salt oi the nitre has been expelled from
the society of the alkaline salt by the more fixed
vitriolic acid that the acid of nitre, now liberated from
