probable tbat nitro-aerial spirit, mixed with the
saline-sulphureous particles of the blood, excites in it
tbe necessary fermentation. And yet it is not to be
supposed that this effervescence of tbe blood takes
place in the beart alone, but that it goes on first in
the pulmonary vessels and afterwards in the arteries
no less than in the beart. Forl do not recognise
that ferment,I know not what, in the left ventricle
of the beart. For whence and by what vessels is
there so great an influx of it as would suffice for
beating so often every day tbe whole mass of tbe
blood? In tbe foetus tbe blood to a great extent
passes direetly from tbe right ventricle of the beart
into the aorta, and yet this ought not to be done ii so
necessary a fermentation took place in the left
ventricle. Much less probable is it that the beating
-of the beart is caused by the rarefaction of the blood
in its ventricles as the famous Descartes supposed.
For if the pulsation ol the beart were caused by the
fermentation gf the blood in its cavities, then, when

the beart beauxits ventricles would be greatly dilated '
· by tbat blood, just as a bladder is blown into the form

ol greatest capacity. And indeed the blood would
not rusb forth so impetuously in the systole as in the
diastole of tbe beart, and not from an impulse derived
from the contraction ol tbe beart, but ou account of
its own rarefaction. But we know in fact, from
vivisections, that the ventricles of the beart are con·
tracted when it beats and are not dilated by the
rarefaction or explosion of the blood, and also that the
blood rushes out when the beart contracts but not
when it relaxes. Indeed, if a motion similar to that
which takes place in systole is exciterl in the beart of
a dead animal, filled with water or any liquid, tbe
liquid contained in it will immediately rusb forth, not
