On Sal Nitrm and M‘tro-Adrial spirit 11

grate, we cannot believe that this results from
sulphureous particles, for it contains none, but from
the igneo-aerial particles contained init and thrown
into very rapid motion. And this will be made still
clearer by what follows.

For 1t is to be noted that for the product' ron of any
flame, it is absolutely necessary, as has been already
pointed out, that there should bet not only sulphureous
particles, but also igneo-aerial particles. To kindle
any sulphureous matter, igneo· aerial particles must
be supplied, either from the air or from nitre pre-
viously added. And this 1s the reason why sulphur
will not take fire 1n a vacuum unlesst nit re has been Ι
mixed with it. But, on the other hand, lor the
kindling of nitre there 1s no need lor' rgneo· -aerial
particles to be supplied from without, because rt will¹
deflagrate readily enough m places from which air is
excluded. But fort 1ts kindling it is quite indispens·,
able ¹that some sulphureous matter be mixed with it.
For if nitre be thrown into a heated crncible it will
not take fite. Il, however, any sulphureous matter be
previously mixed with it, then the nitre, when thrown
into the said crucible, will immediately burst into
flame. Nay, nitre can in no wise be kindled by the
flame of a candle, or by the solar rays, unless sulphur
hasbeen previously mixed with it. And yet the
same nitre if thrown upon charcoal will be easily set
on fire; but this happens because the sulphureous '3
particles of the charcoal ignite it. From these con·
siderations it is undoubtedly established that nitre
has no sulphureous particles contained in it, and this
is why, for its deflagration, sulphureous particles must
be supplied from without. And hence it follows that
nitre supplies in the flame excited by it the igneo· Ι
adrial particles only, but by no means the sulphureous
