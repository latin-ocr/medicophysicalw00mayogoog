CHAPTER V

or Frtnrwmrroiv '

Of Nitra-Ai'rial spirit, so far as fermentations leading to the birth
or death osthrirgs are caused by it.

Wumv nitro-aeria] spirit effervesces with the saline-
sulphureous particles of the earth in the manner
described in the previous chapter, then the nitrous
spirit produced by its action meets the fixed salts of

, the earth, and there is kindled in the earth's bosom that

mild and enduring warmth by which the common
mother fosters and quickens the seeds hidden in her
womb. But that this fermentation may be more
clearly understood, let me first speak shortly of the
fermentative principles of things.

Among the elements of natura-l things nitro-aerial
spirit holds the first place, so that it may rightly be
called Mercury, since it is a substance exceedingly
subtle, agile, and ethereal, and is also the primary
instrument of life and motion not only in plants but
also in animals, as I shall try to show below. Among
the elements of the Peripatetics the two chief are Fire
and Air, but for these two our nitro-aerial mercury
might justly be substituted, since it possesses a really
fiery nature and constitutes also the most active and
fermentative part of the air, as will afterwards be
shown. With regard to the spirit ol the chemists,
which usually leads their band of elements,I am quite
unable to understand what they mean by the very
grand word spirit. For with respect to the spirits ol
fermented liquidsâ€”that is, those which blaze when
