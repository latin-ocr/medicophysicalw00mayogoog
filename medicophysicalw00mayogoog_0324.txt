ends, b and c, tlrau the middle point, a, of the surface
not yet contracted, but that surlace, however much
contracted, can never go beyond the plane, b, c, as the
line, b, e, c, is the shortest between the ends, b, c.
These things being granted, we assert that the
diaphragm in its contractiori is moved towards a
plane, in other words, when it contracts, it goes
towards the cavity ol the abdomen, that is, outwards
and downwards. For ir is known from anatomical
observation that the form of the diaphragm is curved,
and that its concave surface or sinus looks towards
the belly; but now as any curved surlace whatsoever
moves, in contracting, towards a plane, that is, towards ¹
the region to which its concave surface looks, and as
the parts of the abdomen to which the concave
surface of the diaphragm looks are relatively to it,
inferior and exterior, it necessarily follows that when
the diaphragm, in its contractiori, moves towards
them, in its contracted state it goes downwards and
outwards. And besides, this can be seen in vivi·
sections by simple inspection. In this connection I
am much astonished that the eminent Dr Willis, in
his Answer to Dr Highmore, ‘has expressed the
opinion, “ That the diaphragm in violent inspiration,
such as sometimes occurs in the case ol dying
persons, descends beyond the plane and becomes very
convex towards the intestines.'’ For this does not
seem very likely: ior it is not “possible that such a
descent of the diaphragm should be caused by the
lungs taking a long inspiration,'' as the distinguished
author supposed, inasmuch as the inspiration and
the swelling of the lungs are caused by the descent
os the diaphragm and the dilatation of the chest.
But the lungs never cause the descent of the diaphragm,
but in all cases follow its motion, as we have else-
