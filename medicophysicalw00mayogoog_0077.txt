spirit of nitre is expelled as by distillation, the alkaline
salt being left with the terra damnata in the ashes;
and in proportion to the violence with which the
calcination is effected, in that proportion are the salts
alkalised when the nitrous spirit is expelled. Hence
we may gather that it is not advisable violently to
calcine diuretic salts (so named from promoting
uriae), for, by doing so, those salts are deprived of
their nitrous and diuretic spirit. And hence it is
that the lye‚ say of the ashes of Gemitu, is more
efficacious in dropsy than its fixed salt thomughly
alkalised by violent calcination.

The nitrous spirit of plants seems to be clearly
present in a fire of burning charcoal, for the smoke
from that fire assails the nostrils when brought near
to it, very much in the same way as the vapour that
proceeds from the spirit of nitre. And indeed it is
likely that the nitrous spirit which exhales from
burning charcoal in the form of ‘smoke‚ is the reason
for that smoke being so acrid‚ and for its sometimes
causing suffocation.

And further the nitrous spirit of plants manifests
itself strikingly in their fermenting juices‚ when these
have been kept for some time in a glass vessel care·
fully closed. For when these liquids are drunk the
nitrous particles irritare the nervous parts of the
throat with a quite striking pungency and bring on
an almost convulsive choking. So that, when liquids
of this sort are drunk, they are commonly and not
improperly said to cut. Moreover‚ the nitrous par-
ticles in which these liquids abound seem to be the
cause of their being so cold. For nitre mixed with
liquids makes them very cold, and almost freezes
them, as will be shown more fully elsewhere.

In some plants the oily parts are so heavy and so
