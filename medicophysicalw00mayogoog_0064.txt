On Sal Nitrum and Nure-Aerial sz'ra't 27

the fire compose the oil of vitriol very much in the
same way as we showed above that the spirit of
sulphur is produced when sulphur is burned. And
indeed itis probable that the distillation of vitriol
will go on as long as any of the saline particles of the
colcothar remam, these being brought into the fluid
state under the action of heat in the manner afore·
said.

Further‚I do not know but that aeid spirits distilled
from heavy woods, such as Guaiacum wood and the
like, are formed in a similar way by the action of lire
during distillation. Indeed, Guaiacum wood before
distillation does not seem to be endowed with an aeid
but rather with a fixed salt. For its powder or decoe-
tion effervesees when spirit of vitriol (but not when
fixed salt) is poured on it. It corroborates this view
that the saline particles of that wood are in elose
combination with the sulphureous particles, as will
be shown below, whence it is that the nitro-aerial
particles of the fire, encountering the sulphureous
particles of the wood in the course of distillation, rub
the saline particles and bring them into a fluid state
in the manner aforesaid. We observe also in passing
that aeid spirits distilled from sugar and honey appear
to be produced in a not very dissimilar way by the
action of the nitro-aerial spirit of lire. For sueh
plants as have no aeid taste and yet yield an aeid
spirit on distillation are eomposed of sulphureous in
intimate union with saline particles, and are therefore
suited for yielding an aeid liquid in the manner
aforesaid.

As the nitro-aerial spirit of fire, encountering saline-
sulphurcous particles with very brislr motion and
fiery effervescenee, rubs down in a moment and
reduces to a fluid state the saline particles which are
