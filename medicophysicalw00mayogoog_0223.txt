on Respiration 187

suppose that a bladder is enclosed in the cavity of a
pair 01 bellows, and that its neck is 50 fixed to the
pipe of the bellows which is placed in it, that air
blown into the pipe can pass only into the bladder, as
is seen in Plate 11.‚ Fig. 6. (But to ensure this result,
the bladder should be fitted in that manner to the
pipe before the latter is attached to the bellowsl
Further, let the hole be made notas is usual in the
lower blade 01 the bellows, but i n the upper one, and let
it be of considerable size. Let it also be perfectly closed
by a plate of glass, attached to the blade by a suitable
cement‚ so that the bladder shut up within may be seen
through the glass as through a window. When these
preparations have been made, you will see, if the
bellows are opened by drawing the blades apart, the
,bladder swell and extend into the enlarged cavity of
the bellows, as is shown in the figure referred to.
And indeed it is plainly in the same way that the
infiation of the lungs in the dilated chest is produced.

From this we conclude that the lungs are disrended
by the air rushing iu, and that they do not expand of
themselves, as some have supposed; for the rnuscles
and libres which are requisite for any motion are
absent in the lungs. And indeed although the lungs
were provided with muscles, under their contractile
action the lungs would not expand but rather con·
tract, as happens to the bladder and stomaclr, and
other organs 01 the kind. And further, when the
thorax is pierced‚ the lungs immediately collapse at
that place—a clear proof certainly that their move-
ment is not spontaneous, but depends entirely on that
of the chest. As for the nerves which are distributed
in the trachea and bronchia, they do not serve 101
movement, but for sensation and the nutrition 01
these organs.
