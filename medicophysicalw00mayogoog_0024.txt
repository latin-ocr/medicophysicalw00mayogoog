water that has been boiled freezes more quiclrly when
exposed to cold, p. 49. How frost fertilises the earth, p. 50.

Why water dilates when srozen, p. 50. Why water is so
suitable for extinguishing fire, p. 51. Why spirituous liquors
never freeze‚ p. 51. Oi the cause of elasticity, p. 52· On
the various ways in which rigid bodies can be bent, p. 52.
Perfectly rigid bodies cannot have their superficies either
lengthened or shortened, p. 54 Whence that anses, p. 55.
The convex side osa rigid body is carried towards the con·
cave side in the process oi bending, p. 55. The matter of
the bent rigid body suffers compression, p. 56. Why, when
a rigid body is too much bent, it breaks in the middle, p. 56.
Why very solid bodies cannot be bent, p. 56. On the
manner in which bodies not so persectly rigid bend, p. 57.
A certain rule which always holds good in natural effort to
accomplish anything‚ p. 57. Why it is that the thinner rigid
bodies are, so much the more easily can they be bent, p. 58.
The author³s views as to the motion of restitutiom p. 60.
Motion is set up by impulse alone, p. 61. Inanimate things
never begin to move spontaneously, p. 61. A certain subtle
mobile matter is always to be supposed, p. 61. The elastic
force oi rigid bodies seems to arise from the impulse uf
subtle matter, p. or. Why a cord violently stretched con-
tracts spontaneously, p. 63. On the wonderful fracture of
glass drops, p. 63. Why fused glass becomes more con-
tracted in the process of cooling, p. 64.

Air is eminently elastic, p. 67. Why the skin rises into a
cupping·glass applied to it with adame, p. 67. The elastic
force of air is diminished by burning, p. 68. That is proved
by experiments, pp. 68-71. Something a'e'rial is required for
producing flame, p. 71. The air given out from the lungs of
animals has been in part deprived of elastic particles, p. 71.
