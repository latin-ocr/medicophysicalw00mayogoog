earth, adheres almost everywhere to the bottom of

’ the channels by which the waters are carried off.

From what has been said, it may be inferred that
the thermal waters of Bath are impregnated with a
certain acido-saline salt. And indeed this salt of the
thermal waters does not seem to be very unlilre
vitriolated tartar or aluminous salt. But the reason
why these salts do not destroy each other, but that
each of them effervesces with a salt opposed to it, will
be to some extent intelligible from what was said in
the previous chapter. For the said salts are so
imperfect that they are not able to destroy each other
entirely when they combine together. But there will
be a fuller discussion of these salts afterwards.

As lor nitre and sulphur, with which it hasbeen
hitherto supposed that the Bath thermal waters are
impregnated‚ I think that neither of them exists
dissolved in the water of these springs.

That nitre does not exist in them is evident‚
because if the salts which remain alter evaporating
the water of the baths are placed on buming charcoal,
they in nowise deflagrate like nitre. However, l
will not deny that the immature salts of an alkaline
nature (with which the mud and sand ol the baths are
imbued) may, perhaps, if exposed for some time to the
air, be changed by its influence into nitre.

As to sulphur, which isso often said to be present
in nearly all thermal springs, my opinion is that it
does not exist dissolved in these waters For il a
solution of alum, or of vitriol, or any other salt,
whether acid or fixed‚ is mixed with the water ol
these thermal springs, the precipitation of sulphur is
not at all indicated either bya fetid odour or by any
other sign. And yet that always happens in solution

of sulphur made in the water in which quichlime has
