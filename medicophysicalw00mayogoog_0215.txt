oi it will never condense into a liquid. It possesses,
moreover, as much elastic force as ordinary air, as Ι
bave ascertained by the method elsewhere described.

To this I add, lastly, that air interspersed in water
is drawn in by fishes ior respiratory purposes. And
indeed the gills with which fishes are endowed seem
to be formed for this very end, that air (which is ab·
solutely necessary for animal lile) may be separated
from the water by their action and mixed most
intimately with the mass ol the blood. And the
reason that fishes are always engaged in alternately
drawing in and expelling water, as terrestrial animals
do common air, is that something ae'rial which is
necessary to lile may be separated from the water, as
in the other case from the air, and passed into the
mass of the blood.

It corroborates this view that most lishes possessa
swimming-bladder filled with air. For there can be
no doubt that fishes draw this air from the pores of
the water. Let me say also in passing that ila fish is
placed in water contained in a suitable vessel from
which the air is exhausted, it will no longer swim on
its belly, but on the contrary on its back. Its belly
will also rise to some extent above the surlace of the
water. And the reason seems to be that the air
enclosed in the swimmingbladder expands in virtue
of its elastic force as soon as the pressure of the
external air is withdrawn, so that the said bladder
and also the abdominal cavity in which it lies are
inflated by the air, with the result that these swollen
parts are forced upwards by the pressure of the water
while the back of the hsh descends. But il alter the
fish has died for want ol air, external air is again
admitted into the glass, the fish will immediately sink
to the bottom and its belly will again become flaccid.
