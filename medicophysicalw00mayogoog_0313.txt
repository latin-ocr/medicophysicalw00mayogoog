formed inside the bodies of animals—in that chemical
workshop of nature—into volatile salts. And the
same thing is indicated by the fact that if plants
which contain no volatile salt are allowed sofar to
putrefy until they have been converted into worms‚
then at last volatile salt can be obtained in abundance
from thern by distillation.

As to the mode in which the fixed salts of the
food are volatilised‚ it is probable that the various
digestions and fermentations taking place in the
bodies of animals contribule in no small degree to
the volatilisation of the salts: indeed we may hold
that the spleen is the chief workshop in which
the nitrous salts of the food are worked up into
volatile salts. For, indeed, it is to be observed that
when vegetables are burned‚ their nitrous salts are
volatilised ; and they flying off along with sulphureous
particles‚ somewhat dried up, constitute the soot.
And soot abounds in volatile salt, although the
vegetables which, when burned‚ yield it, before their
deflagration, contained only fixed or nitrous salt.
And, as when nitre and sulphur are mixed together
and bumed, as in gnnpowder, it is probable that the
lixed salt, of which nitre in part consists, is volatilised
during the deflagration and flies off in the vapours;
' for otherwise the fixed salt of the nitre would remain
after its combusti0n‚ for in the deflagration of nitre,
the nitro-aerial particles which it contains, set in very
swilt motion by means ol the ignited sulphureous
particles, most finely break up the saline particles
with which they were previously firmly combined,
and, as is probable, makes thern volatile.

But if indeed the exceedingly impetuous and igneous
effervescence ol the nitro-aerial and sulphureous
particles suffices to volatilise in an instant the fixed
