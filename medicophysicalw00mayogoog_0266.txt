of the philosophers long agn. As it, indeed, human

ignorance should be nature's laughingstock, for those
things that are seen every day in our hand and before
our eyes recede furthest away from the grasp and
perception ol our minds, like the unhappy case of
Tantalus. And among these Motion deserves to be
reckoned, lor we know so little how it takes place
that, notwithstanding the evidence of our eyes, its very
existence has been sometimes considered doubtful, and
one of the famous questions discussed in the Schools
was—Is Motion to be taken for granted? And the
Sophist so firmly denied this that it would have been
all up with its existence, had not Motion itself, stirred
up in its own defence, made answer, and set the Peri·
patetic against the Philosopher. But now, if there
are such various difficulties as to motion in general,
how much more obscure is that animal motion, in
which we see to our astonishment enormous bodies
execute quite stupendous movements of their own
accord.

No one doubts that the movements of animals are
produced by the contraction oi the muscles, but how
that contractiou is brought about is the subjectos
varied controversy among authors. Still, the most
generally received opinion is that the fibres of the
muscles are inflated with some elastic matter, so that
while they swell as to breadth they contract as to
length,

And this inflation of the fihres is thus described by
that very distinguished man, Dr Willis, in his Discus·
sion on Muscular Motion. This learned man thinks,
namcly,—“That the Animal Spirits carried from the
brain by the channel of the nerves are stored up in
the tendinous fihreS, asin suitable repositaries3 but
that these spirits, on the incitement to motion being
