RAISE THEMSELVESALOFT

IN the last chapter we have spoken of the motion of
contracting muscles in general, and specially of the
flexor muscles. Lct us now further consider more
closely how the diaphragm moves when it contracts‚
also in what manner the pulsation of the heart is
produced ; and, finally, how the extensor muscles, by
means of which jumping is effected, contract.

First, then, as to the contraction of the diaphragm,
although 1 have discoursed of it in my recently
published treatise On Respiratzhn‚ still there are some
things which may be added here.

In the first place, then, Ι affirm as indubitable that
if a curved surface, the circumference os which is on
all sides fixed to an immovable part, undergoes
contractiori, it will all round be carried towards the
irnmovable part, and the curved surface will ap-
proximate to a plane but will never go beyond the
plane; as is shown in Plate HL, Fig. 5, in which let
b, a, c be the curved surface and b and c its fixed
ends As it contracts it will be brought towards the
plane b, e, c. So that the contracted surface b, d, c,
that is to say its middle point d, is nearer to the
