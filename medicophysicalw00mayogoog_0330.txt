septum is thus made more nearly plane, the heart as
a whole is carried to the left, as may be seen in the
figure. For when a motion has been once impressed
011 the heart it continues for some time, in accordance
with the nature of projectiles余 and thus it comes
about that the heart brought to the left, strikes the
left side of the chest forcibly, though the greater
thickness of the wall of the left ventricle, its more
powerful pulse, not to mention its very shape, so
different from that of the right ventricle, contribute
in no small degree to this effect. And to these
things I may add that the spiral fibres in the walls of
the left ventricle are so arranged that, when they
contract, the heart is twisted by them, so that the
right ventricle is carried backwards towards the spine,
and the left somewhat forwards towards the chesi, so
as to strike it.

From what has so far been said it follows, that if
the blood cannot escape with sufficient freedom from
the ventricles of the beart, on account ol an obstruc-
tion of any sort whatever, either of the pulmonary
vessels or of the great artery, it cannot but be that,
as the heart violently contracts to expel as far as may
be the load of blood, the walls of the ventricles are
widely distended into a ball, and in consequence the
heart is dashed violently against the chest余 so that
the ribs are sometimes pushed out by its blows.
And it may be supposed that palpitation of the
heart, especially when long continued, proceeds from
this cause 余 for although in this affection the pulsation
of the heart is very violent, still the pulse of the
arteries at the wrist is usually quite languid余 as has
been observed by others as well as by ourselves.

BesideS, it points in this direction that in the bodies
of persons who have died of palpitation of the heart,
