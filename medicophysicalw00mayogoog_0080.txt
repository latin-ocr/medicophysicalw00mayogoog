excited, and this must be supposed to result from
the motion ol nitro-aerial particles, as will be shown
immediately. How great moreover is the reseru-
blance and affinity between fire aud all other fer-
mentations will appear from what follows.

With regard to fire, it is to be noted that for the
burning ol things, it' is necessary that nitro-aerial
particles should either be already in the buming
substance or be supplied from the air. Gunpowder
burns very readily on account oi the nitro-aeria]
· particles it contains; plants burn partly from the
nitro-aerial particles they contain, and partly from
such as come from the air; but sulphureous matter,
pure and simple, can only be ignited by nitro-aerial
particles supplied by the air.

And, just as for the production of lire, so also ior
exciting fermentations in plants‚ both sulphureous
and nitro-aerial particles must either exist in the
things to be fermented orbe supplied from without.
The juiee expressed from plants‚ such as the must
oi wine or of apples and the like, effervesces on
account of the nitro-adrial and sulphureous particles
which it contains. For we have shown above that
nitrous salts and therefore also nitro-aerial particles
are contained in most plants‚ though, at the same
time, the nitro-aerial spirit supplied by the air con-
tributes much to the fermentation of these liquids,
for very warrn weather intensifies the action in no
small degree. F urther, that the fermentation of the
aforesaid liquids, as also of all things whatsoever‚ is
due tothe mutual agitation of nitro-aerial and
saline-sulphureous particles, is evident from the lact
that liquids os this kind, and indeed nearly every
thing, become sour in fermenting; for it has been
shown above that acidity is caused by the action oi
