that aerial particles are altered in some way by the
breathing of an animal or the burning of a lamp, and
that they contract in consequence into less space, as
was previously said.

From this it appears to be established that aerial
particles are not fit to sustain fire and life unless they
possess a certain degree of elasticity and ri gidity, since,
in so far as they are less rigid, they do not contain
nitro-aerial particles in sufficient abundance nor can
these be driven out or drawn out quickly enough.

It is also clear from the aforesaid hypothesis why air
passes up in a continual stream to support combustion.
F or Ι do not think that this should be ascribed merely to
the rarefaction of the air mixed with the flame: but
because the aerial particles mixed with the flame are
deprived of nitro-aerial particles, and therefore also of
elasticity, it comes about that they are no longer able
to resist the pressure of the ambient air. Hence such
particles of air as are nearest press into the place of
the ignited particles of the air and drive thern up·
wards‚ since they have lost not only elasticity but also .
their former weight in consequence of the disruption
from them of the extremely solid nitro-aerial particles.
And thus one particle displaces another and the flame
is renewed by a fresh access of air. The following
experiment points also to the same conclusion, viz. :-lf
a small animal such as a mouse or a bird is enclosed in
the manner aforesaid at the top of a glass vessel it will
die much sooner, and the water underneath will rise
much less than if the same animal had been placed in
the lower part of the glass. This will be very manifest
if two birds or two mice are enclosed at the same time,
one in the upper arrd the other in the lower part of
the glass3 for in this case the animal put in the
lower part of the glass will for some time survive the
