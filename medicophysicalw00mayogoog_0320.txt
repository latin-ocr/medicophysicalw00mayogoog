the motion of the nitro-aerial particles? And it tells
in the same direction that a muscle, like the aforesaid
cord, cannot be brought again to its original length
without the exercise of some force. And this is the
reason why a cramp is wont to be produced in a
muscle when its antagonist is paralysed. For when
a muscle is once contracted, it will remain in that
state until it has been restored to its former length
by the pull of its antagonist.

From this hypothesis of ours it is not difficult to
understand how it is that when the motor parts have
been struck by lightning they are not unfrequently
convulsed‚ and remain tense, although the skin
surrounding the muscles is often uninjured. For I
have tried to show above that the nitro-a'e'rial particles,
not only those in the brain¹ but also those in the
motor parts, are sometimes as it were set on fire when
struck by lightning: nay, the nitro-a'e'rial particles
thrown into an almost igneous motion, twist and
wrench the fibrils so violently that they cannot again
be drawn out, but will remain always tense 3 just as it
would happen to the above-mentioned string if it
were brought too near the flame of the lamp.

OF THE MOTION OF CONTRACTING MUSCLES

Now that we have in this way considered how
rnuscular contractiori is caused, it remains for us to
enquire shortly as to the motion of the muscles as
they contract, and also that of the parts attached to
them: hut that this matter may be rnore clearly
understood, l shall premise the following.

ln the first place, we lay it down that if any string
with both ends free contracts uniformly, both of its
ends will be drawn towards the centre.
