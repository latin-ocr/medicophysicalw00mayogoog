THE ANIMAL SPIRJTS ΒΥ WHICH MUSCULAR CON-
TRACTION IS PRODUCED CONSIST OF NITRO·
AERlAz PARTICLES. INCIDENTAlll', AS To THE
MOTION OF THE BRAIN

As to the nature of the Animal Spirits, we may
conclude that they, so far at least as they contribute
to animal motion, consist of Nitro-ae'rial Spirit. But
that this may be more clearly understood, let us first
suppose that nitro-aerial particles, which we have
elsewhere shown to be passed into the blood by
respiration, have also some share in setting up the
performance of motion, as has long been our opinion.
For, indeed, we have remarked a good while ago, in
our Treatise on Respiration‚ that animals in the more
violent exercises, as when much urged in running,
find of all things a *necessity of very much increased
respiration ; and the cause of this seems to be, that in
violent movements the nitro-aerial particles are separ-
ated frorn the mass of the blood to set up the contractiori
of the muscles and are used up, so that there is need of
more frequent respiration by which the blood may

particles for carrying on the function of motion. For
the purpose of the increased respiration in violent exer·
cises is not that the blood coming iri greater abundance
to the central organs and pushed on by the more fre·
quent collapse of the lungs, should pass through them
more easily, for in febrile heat, when, namely, the
blood circulates in a most furious whirl, the respiration
is newertheless no more intense than usual: indeed,
it has been elsewhere shown that the blood can pass
