On Muscular Motzon and Anr'rmzl Spr'rits 247

the effervescence arising from the meeting of contrary
salts takes place only slowly, and usually lasts for some
time, and that this does not agree with the instan-
taneous contraction of the muscles‚ as we have indi·
cated above.

So that for effecting the contractiori of the muscles
there is required an excitement of the clastic particles,
of a kind that can be accomplished instantaneously
and without any sort of coagulation. And indeed 1
do not know if there be in the nature of things any
other such fermentation but the singular case ol the
effervescence of nitro-a'e'rial and saline-sulphureous
particles, which mutually‚ as their nature is, excite
themselves to a most rapid motion. We must there·
fore conclude that it is from that that muscular con-
traction proceeds. And if the one set ol motive
particles, as lhave tried to show above, are of a saline-
sulphureous nature, it is most necessary that the other
set of motive particles should be of the nitro-aerial
kind, inasmuch as these alone are by their nature fitted
for exciting the saline-sulphureous particles.

I think it has been established from what has been
elsewhere said, that nitro-aerial and sulphureous
particles effervesce when mixed with one another, but
to these evidences the following experiment may be
added. If, namely‚ the most highly rectified spirit of
wine be mixed with spirit of nitre deprived of its
moisture, a conspicuous heat will presently be pro-
duced, at all events if the mixture be slightly warmed ;
and the explanation ol this seems to be that the
nitro-adrial particles (which we have elsewhere shown
to abound in the spirit of nitre) and the very volatile
saline-sulphureous particles of which the spirit of wine

consists excite one another to motion, ns is their
nature, for it must not be supposed that the spirit of
