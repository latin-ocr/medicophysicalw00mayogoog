the septum of the heart. Now, I say, inasmuch as in
the contraction of the wall, a, b, its one end, b, that is
the cone of the beart, is carried towards c, because of
the simultaneous contractior] of a, e, the septum of
the heart, that wall is, in its contraction, carried
outwards to d, and forms the line a, d, c, which,
although shorter than the line, a, i, b, still rises as a
tumour at d. The distention of the wall is to no
small extent due to the impulse of the blood which,
strongly compressed by the contractiori of the heart,
as it cannot all immediately be driven into the great
artery, gives a blow to the wall of the ventricle.
Should any one ask here how the blood contained
within the contracted ventricle, a, d, c, is expelled
from it (lor it is not to be supposed that in the systole
of the heart the extreme part of the heart moves
quite up to the base of the heart, but that some space
remains between them),l answer that it has not yet
been established that all the blood leaves the
ventricles each time that they contract. And at
any rate, if the ventricles of the heart were nearly
emptied of blood it would seem that what remains of
the blood could not be compressed by them with
force sufficient lor the projection ol the blood to the
furthest rnembers of the body. If, however, all the
blood is expelled from the ventricles, we must suppose
that the walls of the ventricles continue their
contractiori lor some little time alter that first rush
ol the heart by which the pulsation is started. For
otherwise it seems impossible that all the blood
should be driven by the beat ol the heart so
instantaueously into the great artery. And it tells
in favour of this, that in the section of animals, when
the dying heart is opened, the movement of contraction
is seen to be completed not at one stroke, but to
