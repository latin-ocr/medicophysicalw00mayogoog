Let us also ponder brielly whether the gentle
warmth produced in the egg by the heat of the
incubating fowl does not contribute in some measure
to compensate for the want of respiration. For it
was elsewhere shown that nitro-aerial particles are
detached from the aerial particles by the fermentation
of the blood, and that these, in animals, serve the
purpose of respiration. Further, it ought to be
noted that heat ol all kinds is produced by the
motion of nitro-aerial particles.

But now as it is altogether needful for the genera·
tion of the chick that a gentle warmth be excited in
the egg, by the heat of the incubating fowl or other-
wise, why should we not suppose that nitro-aerial
particles (from the communication ol which to the
egg its warmth arises) supply to some extent the
place ol respiration in the egg? Certainly the nature
of the white of egg seems to be such as is suitable
lor the detention and entanglement ol nitro-adrial
particles, inasmuch as it consists of aviscid fluid, and
that, too, impregnated with saline particles liberated
from union with sulphureous particles It corro-
borates this view that the white ol an egg, if whipped
rapidly witha rod or spoon, becomes frothy more
than all other substances on account ol the abundant
intermixture with it of adrial matter. Itis therefore
probable that nitro-aerial particleS, when conveyed to
the egg by the warmth of the incubating fowl, are
detained there by its albugineous humour; and that
when at last collected by the almost innumerable
ramifications of the umbilical vessels and then

brought in great abundance to the foetus, they
compensate in some degree for the want of respiration
in the egg. For the chief use of the respiration
ol animals is to introduce nitro-aerial particles
