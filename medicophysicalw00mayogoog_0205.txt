On Sal Nr'trum and Miro-Ae'nbl Spmt 169

the alkaline salt of quieklime leaves its own aeid and
combines with the aeid of vitriol), although the aeid
salt is first precipitated from the embrace of the
alkaline salt, still the liquid does not become in the
least degree turbid, because that aeid salt which sinks
is in nowise opaque but soluble in the liquid, and
consequently transparent and imperceptible.

Nor should we omit to state that quieklime mixed
with the lye ol ashes renders it more powerful and
acrid. And yet in water which has slaked lime the
aeid salt, which is entirely opposed to the lixivia! salt,
seems to have the upper hand, since precipitation will
take place in that water if an alkaline salt is put into
it, as was said before.

In regard to this it is probable that the aqueous
part of the lye, when poured upon quieklime, no
sooner meets the very fiery and dry aeid salt of the
lime and renders it fit as it were for dissolving, so that
it effervesees with the alkaline salt (for it was shown
above that the aeid ol lime does not, unless diluted
with water, effervesee with an opposite salt), than
the alkaline salt with which the lye is imbued eom-
bines at onee with the aeid salt of the lime and so
destroys its powers that the alkaline salt which
belongs to the lime is not now, as in other cases,
conquered and subjugated by the aeid of the lime, but
may be extraeted from the water ol the lye with its
powers unimpaired. Since, therefore, the alkaline salt
of quieklime is extremely acrid and fiery, it necessarily
follows that the lixivial water impregnated with it
becomes in the highest degree biting, eaustie, and

fiery.
