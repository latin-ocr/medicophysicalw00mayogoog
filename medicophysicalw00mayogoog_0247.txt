ΟΝ THE RESPIRATlON OF
THE FOETUS IN THE UTERUS
AND IN THE EGG

Snvcu the necessity of breathing is so essential to the
sustaining of life that to be deprived ol air is the same
as to be deprived of the common light and the vital
spirit, it will not be out ol place to inquire here how
it happens that the loetus can live though imprisoned
iu the straits of the womb and completely deprived
of the access of air. For it is not enough to say that
the blood of the child is brought during the period ol
gestation through the firramen ovale and the ductus
artem'osus, and circulates well enough without the
movement of the lungs, while the mass of the blood
takes its course, alter birth, through the lungs, which
it cannot traverse without the help of respiration.
For respiration serves another purpose thau trans-
mitting the blood through the lungs; otherwise the
lungs would be altogether superfluous, since the blood
could have been carried round by another passage as
is done in the uterus. Nay, the blood can pass
through the lungs themselves without the aid of
respiration, as has been pointed out elsewhere.
