calcination of the calcareous stoue. For as the aeid
spirit of sulphur is produced from the more fixed par·
ticles of common sulphur, also the spirits of vitriol and
of nitre lrorn metallic or earthy sulphur, by the action
of uitro-aerial and igneous spirit, as I have before
attempted to show, so it is likely that the nitro-aerial
particles of fire eneounter, in the course of the long·
continued calcination of the calcareous stone, the more
fixed particles ol the sulphur os the stone (lor cal·
careous stone, like flints, contains much sulphur), aud
rub and sharpen them, and at last convert them into
an aeid salt in the manner described above.

Let us see next how it is that contrary salte-aeid,
to wit, and alkali-subsist together in quicklime and
yet do not act upon each other until water is poured
on the lime. As regards this, it is probable that the
aeid spirit of quicklime becomes so sharp and fiery in
consequence of its long calcination, as to be altogether
unfit lor engaging with fixed salts until its more
powerful igneous force is diluted by admixture with
water and to some extent moderated; for saline
solvents are sometimes so corrosive that they fail to
dissolve or in any way affect metals, which in their
nature closely resemble fixed salts, till their too keen
force is diminished by admixture of water.

Further, the fixed, like the aeid, salt ol the quick-
lime becomes in the highest degree biting and fiery
by reason of the fiery particles infixed in it during
its long calcination. For it is to be noted that
although nitro-aerial and igneous particles areos a
saline nature, still they are opposed neither to aeid salt
nor to alkali‚ but, on the contrary, when combined
with either, increase its power and render it fiery. But
since nitro-aerial particles are fixed in dense number
in the aeid, and in the fixed‚ salt ol lime, it comes to
