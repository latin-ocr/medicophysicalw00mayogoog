CHAPTER IV

OF THE SOURCE OF ACID LIQUIDS: ALSO OF THE
TERRESTRJAL PART OF THE SPJRI T OF NITRE

Tunr the spirit os nitre is a compound‚ and that it
is derived partly from the air and partly from the
earth, has been shown above. We have already
treated of its aerial part; so that its terrestrial and
aeid part remains for discussion.

It is extremely difficult to understand how the
spirit of nitre originates in the earth. For earth
appears to possess the nature ofa fixed, rather than
of an aeid, salt. And yet it is undoubtedly true
that if exposed to the air it will, after some lapse
of time, be impregnated with nitre. But it has
been shown above that the aeid salt of which the
nitre in part consists originates in the earth. But
that it may be understood how the aeid spirit of nitre
is generated in the earth, let me be allowed to pre-
fix some observations regarding the spirit of sulphur
and other aeid liquids, because there exists among
all aeid spirits a very great likeness and affinity.

Hitherto the opinion has prevailed that an aeid
salt oi a vitriolic nature lies concealed in the struc-
tureos sulphur, and that frorn this, exhaling in the
deflagration oi sulphur and collected in a superinr-
posed glass bell-jar, the aeid spirit of sulphur is
composed. But it seems scarcely probable that a
spirit so corrosive should reside in common sulphur,
which has a sweetish and by no means aeid
taste. Nay, sulphur seems to have rather the
