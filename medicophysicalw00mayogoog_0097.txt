be drawn downwards towards the rod, But indeed
since the rigid body is as solid and compact in respect

to its external parts as the more slender rigid body or
even more so (for the exterior parts ofa thick rigid
body, be it glass or iron, aremore quickly cooled than
the interior, so that it is extremely solid as respects
its external surfaces—in so far as the nitro-aerial
particles in endeavouring to escape are detained in
the exterior parts which have now cooled down, and
are fixed there as we have already shown-but this
does not take place in a more slender rigid body, since
all its parts are cooled at nearly the same moment),
hence I say it results that the convex surface ofa
thicker rigid body cannot bear to be drawn out as far
as is necessary for bending it without compression of
its parts, so that i is now necessary that the convex
surlace ol the shortened rigid body should also go
inwards and make, say the line h, m, h, in the figure ; Ι
and that cannot be done without notable compression.
And the further the two surfaces are from one another,
so much the more must the convex surlace pass
inward during the bending, and consequently the
matter of the rigid body will suffer the greater corn-
pression; so that very thick rigid bodies cannot be
bent. And thus it is that a broad and thin plateis
easily bent so far as regards the 'broad surfaces which
are near each other, while as regards the lateral sur-
faces which are much farther apart it cannot be bent.

While we thus maintain that the power of recoil in
rigid bodies should be ascribed to the compression of
their matter, I would not be understood as thinking
that matter thus compressed endeavoured to extend
itself, lor that would be to assume elasticity but not to
explain it, and any one would be ready to ask:
whence arises the power of recoil in the compressed
