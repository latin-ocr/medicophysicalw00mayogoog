openings of the umbilical vessels only by a sort ol
percolation through the membrane.

In the opinion ol others the umbilical arteries are
designed with a view to carry off the excess of food
which is brought to the child through the umbilical
vein. But surely there is no reason for accusing
Nature of gluttony, as though it were not enough to
crarn alter birth even to surleit and vomiting without
doing it also in the uterus by the arrangement of
Nature. Further, whatever is carried away by the
said arteries is brought back again by the umbilical
vein, and so the child would be forced, as it were, to
return to its vomit. Nor should it be said here that
only the cruder parts ol the blood are conveyed by
the umbilieal arteries to the placenta, that, alter
lurther decoction there, they may become fit for
nutrition. For whence, Ι ask, that elective attraction
in virtue of which it is the cruder parts ol the blood
rather than the purer which traverse the ducts of
the umbilieal arteries that stand so widely open?
Further, it is scarcely to be believed that nourish-
ment presented to the child is so raw that it has to
be thrust out of doors to be further cooked. For how
much wiser it would be to prepare it properly at first.

Nor ought we to agree with those who think that
the umbilical arteries exist in order that the blood of
the embryo may circulate by passing through the said
arteries, and then returning by the umbilical vein.
For the blood ol the infant can be carried round
easily enough through the aorta and the vena cava
just as after birth. Nor is there any ground for
saying that these vessels are not yet formed in the
embryo; lor it is certain that the great artery in
which the umbilical arteries originate, is in existence
from the first, and indeed it is not in the least to be
