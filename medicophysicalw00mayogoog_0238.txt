supposed, drawn upwards when contracted by
repeated irritations. For in systole and in its cou-

traction, it is drawn downwards, as shown above, and
so causes inspiration rather thau that expiration
which takes place in laughter. From what has been
said it is evident that risibility is peculiar to man not
because the nerve oi the diaphragm communicates in
man, but not in beasts, with the cervical plexus, and
by means oi it with the hrain-an opinion which the
learned Dr Willis has maintained in his book on the
Anatomy of the Brain. For laughter does not take
place because the diaphragm, on account of an
instigation brought by the said nerve from the hrain,
contracts violently with repeated throbs and com·
presses the lungs, as this learned man supposed. For
it has been shown that laughter does not proceed
from the action or systole oi the diaphragm, but, on
the contrary, from its diastole.

We have spoken thus sar ol the manner in which
respiration takes place, aud it now remains for us to
inquire into its use. This is indeed a most difficult
affair, lor there is not more accord as to its necessity
than doubt as to its use.

For not only is air inspired uselul for tasting and
smelling‚ and expelled, lor talking, shouting‚ cough·
ing, sneezing, and spitting, and again, when retained,
for the expulsion of urine aud faeces, for parturition,
and for moving on the chyle, the lymph, and the
blood; the breath we inspire is destined for astill
uobler use: from which arises such a necessity of
drawing breath that we cannot indeed live a moment
without it.

Some suppose that respiration chiefly serves for
cooling the heart; but heating rather thau such a
cooling seems to suit the circulation and fermentation
