and almost harmless. For it a finger or anything
combustible is thrust into the blue flame of sulphur,
but not into the sulphur mass, it will not be burned
as by other lires, but will remain for some time
nninjured. To this we add further that the flame
of sulphur does not expand like other flames but
bursts forth from time to time and seems as it were
to effervesce. From this it is to be inferred that
there is a third substance mixed with it on which the
fiery particles act. And that these particles, of a saline
or metallic nature, mixed with the flame of the sulphur
and sharpened by the rubbing of the nitro-aerial
particles and brought at last to afluid state, constitute
the aeid and corrosive spirit of sulphur, we take to be
at least a probable conjecture; for otherwise l have no
notion how the aeid spirit is produced, for it is improb-
able that it exists in the structure of the sulphur
before its combustion, as has been shown above.

, Το this we further add that the oil ol vitriol expelled
after several days' distillation seems to be produced
in nearly the same way. For it is certain from
experience that if the distillation of vitriol is con·
tinued with the strongest fire for ten or even more
days, aeid spirit will still all the while pass into the
receiver. But it is scarcely t0 be believed that any
acid spirit is so fixed and ponderous as to be able to
remain so long in the hottest fire. We must rather
suppose that nitro-aerial particles of the fire, in the
course of the long continued distillation of the vitriol,
encounter the metallic sulphur of the colcothar andr
effervesce--the result being that the saline particles
of that sulphur which are placed among the mutually
rubbing fiery particles are pounded and comminuted
so as at last to be sharpened and brought into a fluid
state. And these at last carried up by the force of
