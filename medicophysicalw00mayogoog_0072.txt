On Sal Nitrum and Nitro-A'e'n'al spirit , 35

thrown into the fire-they are to be referred to the
second element ol the chemists, to wit, sulphur. But
corrosive and saline spirits which alone remain ought
to be entered in the register of the salts. So that
,ι clearly nitro-airial particles should alone be dis-
tinguished by the name ol spirit. Nitro-aerial spirit
appears·in very different conditions according as it
is at rest or in motion, and that slower or very nimble,
as will be shown more fully below.

ln the list of elements sulphur has a claim to the
next place because after nitro-aerial mercury it is
the most fermentative. And indeed, except these
two, there do not seem to be any active elements.
Sulphur is seen in various states for now it lies inert
and lulled to sleep, now it is raised to proper vigour
. and maturity; sometimes indeed it is extremely fierce
and irrepressible, as will be shown below.

Nino-aerial spirit and sulphur are engaged in
perpetual hostilities with each other, and indeed from
their mutual struggle when they meet and from their
diverse state when they succumb by turns all the
changes of things seem to arise.

Salt, which has apassive nature, should be reckoned
as the third of the elements. For in whatever way
it may be volatilised there never, l think, begins in
it a dance of internal movements. Salt is either fixed
or volatile, both are however of nearly the same
nature: but there is a greater variation in the con-
dition ol salt when it is changed from purely saline
into aeid. Salt has great affinity and relationship with
nitro-aerial spirit and also with sulphur, for these
very active elements are by turns married to salt as
to a fitting bride, and are fixed in its embrace, as will

presently be shown.
Besides the elements already mentioned, water and
