who hold that the thicker and more fixed part of the
blood is detained in the substance of the spleen, and
that it, by being long kept, acquires a fermentative
character; for if particles os blood anywhere cease
from movement and stagnate‚ these particles will
prevent those immediately following from continuing
their motion, and thus, the circulation of the blood
being in that part interrupted‚ swelling and inflamma-
tion will necessarily result. Moreover, the numerous
branches of nerves disseminated in the spleen seem
to serve no other purpose but that ol conveying
fermentative particles.

BesideS, as, when the fermentation in the spleen is
too remissly performed the blood becomes too crude,
so on the other hand if it is increased beyond a right
extent the mass of the blood acquires a somewhat
dried and atrabilious character. Indeed, as in fire
the nitro-aerial particles effervescing most intensely
with the sulphureous particles burn them up in an
instant and turn them into smoke‚ as we elsewhere
show, so also if in the parenchyma of the spleen
the nitro-aerial and the saline-sulphureous particles
work together too much, it comes to pass that these
particles become to some small extent dried up and
sooty, and from them, fixed in the substance ol the
spleen, its dark purple colour seems to come. But
that atrabilious diathesis of the blood may arise from
a twolold cause.

1. If the saline-sulphureous particles of the blood
are detained in the spleen by reason of its paren·
chyma being obstructed ; for thus they, by effervescing
too long with the nitro-aerial particles, become
torrefied and dried. Indeed the mass of the· spleen
seems to be composed ol two kinds of vessels ; of which -
one, consisting of nervous fibros, is destined for the
