it is implied in our idea ol a perlectly rigid body that
none ol its sides can be lengthened or shortened.

We may gather from what has been said that the
matter ol a rigid body undergoes when bent a uotable
compression-and that, especially, at the middle, as is
obvious from Plate I., F ig. 5. For when the convex
surlace b, e, d, ol the beut rigid body has been brought
inwards towards the concave surface a, c, the matter of
the rigid body at e must suffer a notable compression.
Hence the reason is obvious why rigid bodies when
bent too much usually break near the middle. Just as
in making bows this alone is attended to that their
middle part be thick and strong enough, while it is of
no consequence if the ends are thinuer.

Indeed if a rigid body be so compact aud solid that
there are no interstices between its parts, and it
cannot, in consequence, be compressed into less space,
then clearly such a rigid body cannot hebent but will
rather break. For it should be observed that rigid
bodies which cau be bent, although their outer surlaces
are extremely s0hd and firmly compacted, have very
many little spaces in their interior, as is clearly the
case in iron and glasS, which are specially rigid, For
when glowing iron or glass is plunged into water, that
they may cool quickly and become rigid, their outer
parts cool sooner than their inner, and on that account
become more rigid and solid. For the nitro-adria]
particles which are in the still heated interior open
little spaces here and there, in order to continue their
motions, and when they gradually extricate themselves
outwards they are detained in the now cooled surface
and render it exceedingly solid, although very many
empty little spaces are left in the interior.

Thus lar then of bodies of the greatest rigidity-that
is bodies whose sides can neither be lengthened nor
