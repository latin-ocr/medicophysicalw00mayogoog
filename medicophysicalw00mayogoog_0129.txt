entering the fiery element in the manner described,
immediately glow and are impregnated anew with
nitro-aerial particles, and are moreover rendered heavier

by the accession of the nitro-aerial particles (just as
antimony when calcined by the solar rays is in·
creased in weight on account ol the nitro-aerial
particles infixed in it, as has been elsewhere shown):
and, finally, that the nitro-a'e'rial particles when impreg-
nated in that way and made heavier are by their own
weight borne downwards to the coldest region of the
air, and being rapidly cooled there become extremely
rigid and acquire anew resilient force. For the case
here seems not to differ much from what happens
when solt and inelastic iron is made to glow by putting
it into the fire, and is then immediately cooled by
plunging it into cold water, so that it thus recovers
its rigidity and resilient force.

It is besides probable that the adrial particles, when
made rigid in the manner aforesaid and borne down-
wards by their weight, are likewise in some degree
bent b'y the weight of the superincumbent air, so that
they no longer move straight like arrows but begin to
rotate. Hence it is that they at last, like the steel
spring which sets automata in motion, are bent in
multiple convolutions and crowded together. And
thus, it seems, there ultimately arises in the ,aerial
particles that conspicuous elasticity and tendency to
expand indefinitely.

As regards the descent of ae'rial particles they are
probably not borne straight down, but obliquely
towards the poles. For the continual ascent of
vapours and of air which goes on in the meridional
region, on account of the very intense heat there and
the rarefaction of the air, hinders their straight
descent3 so that, returning obliquely from the poles,
