nitro-aerial spirit, Should any one be inclined to
think that the fermentation of¹ the said liquids
ought not to be classed among effervescences with
a destructive tendency, l reply that although the
juices expressed from plants become more perfect
by fermentation so far as their use to man is cou-
cerned, yet, in respect to the compound whose
structure it impairs‚ the aforesaid effervescence is
rightly called destructive,

But when the deeay of things is caused by extran-
eous heat and moisture, the infernal movement is

Ι mainly effected by nitro-aerial particles supplied by

the air. For nitro-aerial particles abound in a moist
warmth; for we must suppose that heat of all kinds
is due to their motion. When therefore nitro-aerial
particles enter any substance along with extraneous
moisture, they engage in conflict with the saline-
sulphureous particles which they meet, and in con-
sequence of their mutual agitation the structure of
the compound is ‘dissolved. Hence such things as

’ ’ corruption. And this is the reason why vegetable

fruits, and even flesh, when covered with butter are
preserved for a long time from putrefying‚ also iron
smeared with oil is not corroded by rust. And
indeed oil and other things containing sulphur
appear to be extremely well adapted for excluding
nitro-aerial spirit. For sulphureous and nitro-aerial
particles, from their mutual enmity, keep off and
repel each other, as Ι have attempted to show in
another place; and for a similar reason, spices which
are full of sulphur keep dead bodies for a long time
from putrefying.

lt is an additional proof of the foregoing that
those things which consist of a combination of
