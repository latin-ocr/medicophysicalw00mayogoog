effervescence os its aeid salt with the fixed salt ol the
lime.

Further, common sulphur, boiled in the water in
which quicklime has been slaked, will dissolve exactly
as it would in a liquid imbued with an alkaline salt.
However, if spirit of vitriol or any acid liquid be
poured into the solution, the sulphur will at once be
precipitated with a fetid smell; so that it is certainly
established that the solution ol sulphur in the water
in which quicklime has been slaked, is due to its
alkaline salt, lor otherwise the sulphur would not be
precipitated from that water when aeid liquids are
poured into it.

To this I further add that if quicklime be put intoa
solution ol sal armoniae, whatever of aeid there is in
the sal armoniae will be absorbed by the fixed salt of
the lime, while the volatile sal armoniae, liberated
from the saline letters, passes meanwhile into vapours,
just as if fixed salt ol tartar had been mixed with the
sal armoniac. Now all these things clearly prove

that quicklime and the water in which it has been
slaked are impregnated with a fixed salt; and this

we may see sor ourselves, lor it is certain from common

observation that an alkaline salt, or at least a nitrous

salt partly composed ol an alkali, exudes from walls
] which have been recently whitewashed and adheres
. to them.
' Further‚ the existence of acid salt in lime may be
inserted from what follows. For if a solution of any
fixedsalt be mixed with the water of quicklime, pre·
cipitation will immediately take place and the water
Wlll become milky‚ which would not, however, happen
unless that water were imbued with some aeid salt.
Resides, the water of quicklime poured upon any
volatile salt fixes it and changes it into an insoluble
