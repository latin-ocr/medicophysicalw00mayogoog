minutes only, will die immediately alter its breath is
stopped, this is not because the movement of the
blood is prevented; for the blood could be carried
round by the foramen ovale and the ductus artenhsun
since these passages to which it is accustomed, are
not yet closed.

Itis therefore to be absolutely concluded that the
necessity lor breathing arises from this, that certain
nitro-a'e'rial particles requisite for the support ol life
are transmitted by means ol the lungs into the blood,
as Ι consider to be established by what is stated
elsewhere. And therefore inasmuch as the foetus
cannot breathe in the womb, as the air is excluded, it
is necessary that the lack ol respiration should be
supplied from another source.

For we cannot agree with those who maintain that
the foetus breathes even in the' womb-—a view upheld
on the strength ol the vagitus uterinus and the ructio
infantuli. But indeed it seems to me that air cau
just as well pass to the blood, without respiration,
through the skin and veins, as penetrate the closed
uterus and the many membranes which enfold the
foetus. Although Ι would not deny that vapours
arising from the fermentation of juices are perhaps
sometimes contained in the ammon, and these may
produce the vagitus uterinus and the suctzh, but they
cannot serve the purpose ol respiration, since they
would need to be driven out oftener from the lungs ol
the embryo. Indeed, lor the ructio infantuli, there is
no need at all that air or vapours should be contained
in the amnion, for the external air, by compressing
and pushing not only the outer parts of the body, but,
by their intervention, all the internal parts als0, and,
consequently, the liquids of the amnion, is able to
cause suction in the uterus.
