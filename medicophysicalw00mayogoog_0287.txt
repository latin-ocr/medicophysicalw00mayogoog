On Mascular Motzbn and Aminal Spirits 251

of the learned Dr Willis had no small weight with
me; he supposes that the animal spirits areos the
nature os volatile salt. For this learned man in his
treatise on Dzseases of the Braz'n, chapter xi, speaks
as follows: And indeed the Animal Spirits when in a
healthy and regular condition seem to behaoe to some
extentas a spirituous liquor full of volatile salt which
dbtz'ls from the blood. But, indeed, with all respect to
so eminent a man, since muscular contractiori is pro-
duced by particles of diverse kinds mixed together
and mutually moving themselves (as is the view of
the learned author, and as also seems most consonant
with reason), is the animal spirits consist of volatile
salt, then the other motive particles supplied hythe
blood must be aeid salt, for otherwise the animal
spirits meeting them would not effervesco: but it is
scarcely to be supposed that acid salt can have a
place in a healthy body, much less in the motor parts,
as has been shown above. Should we admit that an
acid liquid is contained in the fibres, why should not
the animal spirits effervescing with it sometimes theni-
selves tur'n into an acid liquid, as does happen, accord-
ing to the learned author’s opinion, in Melancholia
aud Mania? Wherefore it seems preferable to sup·
pose that the animal spirits consist of nitro-adria]
particles, which proceeding, on the determination of
the mind, from the brain into the motor parts, meet
there the saline-sulphureous particles, and that by
their mutual agitation taking place according to their
nature, the contraction of the fibrils is effected in the
way to be described below. Indeed, I imagine the
animal spirits to be of such a sort that they never
undergo change ς and as to the diseases which are

commonly believed to depend on their vitiated condi·
tion, I consider that they arise from the interrupted
