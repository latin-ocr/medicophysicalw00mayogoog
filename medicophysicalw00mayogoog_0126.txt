HOW AIR WHEN DEPRIVED OF Nlrrto-AE'RJAL
PARTICZES IS SUPPLIED WI ΤΗ YHEM ANE W

Since aerial particles, whether by the burning of
lires or the respiration of animab, are deprived in the
manner aforesaid of nitro-aerial particles, let us con·

sider how it is that air is not at last all consumed by
the buming of fires and the breathing ol animals, or
at least rendered so effete as to be no longer ableto
sustain flame and lile. As to this, it may be supposed
that air when deprived ol nitro-a'e'rial particles and
therefore also of its elasticity and weight (as was pre-

viously shown) is impelled upwards by the pressure ol
the rest of the air, and that when raised on high it is
then impregnated anew with nitro-aerial particles.
For indeed it is probable that nitro-aerial particles,
being extremely small and volatile, float in the higher
regions of the air, and that when collected there in
sufficient abundante they constitute, in accordante
with their diverse conditions‚ the elements either oi
fire or of cold.

With regard to the element of fire, it is probable that
it dwells in the very body of the sun, which appears
to be nothing but an immense chaos of nitro-aeria]
particles carried-round in a perpetual whirl with the
swiftest motion. Indeed,I think, there is very little
difference between the light of the suu aud its ruys
collected by means of a burning-glass‚ in which nitro-
a'e'rial particles are engaged in igneous motion without
accompanying sulphureous particles, as we have else-
where indicated. For although sulphureous particles
are required at first to put nitro-aeria] particles in
motion and to kindle sublunary bros, still we must
suppose that the nitro-aerial particles in the sun, not
