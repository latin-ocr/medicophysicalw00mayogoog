On Sal Nitrum» and mtto-Amul Spt'rt't 149

when the clouds dash violently against one another
in this way, the air around is necessarily thrown into
a tremulous motion; and this agitation ol the air is
conveyed, with sourcely any loss of time, to a great
distance, on account of the continuity os the atmo-
sphere. Nay‚ in whatever manner thunderstorms are
produced, the air-must certainly be agitated with a
very great commotion.

Now Ι certainly think it is probable that the aerial
particles, since they are solid and rigid, strike lorcibly
against each other iu consequence of the violent
concussion of the air produced in a thunderstorm,
and that they wear themselves by the powerlul and
sudden mutual shock. The consequence is, that the
nitro-aerial particles, struck out lrom the aerial particles
and thrown into a fiery motion, produce a certain light
and momentary flame (such as that ol lightning is)
which extends over nearly the whole hemisphere.
For it is very much as though an immense congeries
of very small fiints were struck with so violent a blow
that an almost infinite number of sparks ol fire should
be struck out from the collision of its innumerable
particles; lor in this case a certain light flame, pro·
pagated through the whole aggregate ol flints‚ would
*be suddenly kindled. Besides Ι do not know whether
or not the nitro-aerial particles disseminated among
the aerial particles (from some sort of impulse ol
which, I assume that light arises) can be thrown by
the violent concussion ol the atmosphere into such
a motion as is requisite for the productiori of light.
And indeed if lightning were light and nothing
more, it would seem to be due sometimes to this
cause.

As to the fervent and very intense sultriness‚ which
olten precedes thunderstorms, it must not be thought
