On MuscuIar Motion and Am'mal Spirits 279

adrial particles brought with the mass ol the blood
should be transmitted into the brain and the nerves
arising in it. If the nitro-aerial particles are either
not carried in sufficient quantity to the brain, or are
unable to pass along the nerves on account of their
obstruction, the animal economy and the motive
iunction cannot but be disturbed. And from this
cause apoplexy, paralysis, and diseases of that kind
seem not rarely to originale, as has been stated
above.

As the nitro-adrial particles have to be sent to the
brain, so on the other hand the saline-sulphureous
particles have to be altogether excluded from it;
for if they, citheron account ol their extreme tenuity,
or because the passages of the brain are too open,
or on account of too intense fermentation of the
blood, make their way into the brain, they excite the
nitro-adrial particles, i.e., the animal spirits, to in-
ordinate motions. Hence the animal economy is
much perturbed, as probably happens in intoxica-
tion‚ epilepsy, and other diseases of the kind: for
liquors full of volatile sulphur, such as spirit of wine
and the chemical oils ol vegetables, when taken too
quickly, not infrequently produce the diseases
mentioned. An observation which Ι have made
more than once points in the same direction. For
I have known persons subject to paroxysms of a
maniacal sort and also convulsions, whose sputum,
while they were suffering from such paroxysms,
burst into flame like oil, or rather in the manner of
gunpowder, when it was put into the fire: it is indeed
probable that in this case the saline-sulphureous
particles of the blood had been carried so far that
they burst into the recesses of the brain aud there
excited the animal spirits to inordinate motions.
