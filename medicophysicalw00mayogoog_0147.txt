mixed with the too highly exalted saline-sulphureous
particles of purulent matter, excite a very intense
effervescence and lebrile heae

When saline-sulphureous and nitroadrial particles
effervesce so much in longcontinued severs, it comes
about that the volatile salts of the blood are so worn
that they change at last, in the manner already
described, into acid salts And hence it is that the
blood acquires an aeid nature alter long-continued
fevers; indeed the case is not very different from
that of strong ale, which alter long fermentation is
-converted into vinegar. Nay, even when the fer-
mentation of the blood goes on aright, its saline
particles are in course of time sharpened and liquefied
by the action of the nitro-aerial spirit, and in
combination with other (volatile) salts constitute a
>certain acidosaline salt not very unlike Sal-Armoniac.
And thus it is that urine is impregnated with a certain
Sal-Armoniac, and the prool of this is that copper
is corroded by urine in the same way as by Sal·
Armoniac. Further, a solution of sulphur made in
lye is precipitated by urine poured on it just as by
any aeid liquid. Hence if ashes have urine or even
blood mixed with them, volatile salt will in distillation
be abundantly derived from them, inasmuch as the
fixed salt ol the ashes absorbs whatever of aeid there
is in the urine, so that its volatile salt, freed from the
acid salt, readily ascends, precisely as happens in dis-
tilling Sal-Armoniac mixed with fixed salt.

Besides the uses thus far assigned to nitro-aerial
spirit, a very great many other offices are served by it.
For when nitro-aerial particles effervesce with the
mass of the blood in the manner aforesaid, its saline-
sulphureous particles are brought to due volatility,
just as the sulphureous particles from terrestrial matter
