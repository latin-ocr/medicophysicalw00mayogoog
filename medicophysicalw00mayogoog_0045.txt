acidity‚ and become to some extent nitrous. More·
over, steel filings if exposed to moist air, are corroded
just as they would be by aeid fluids, ¹and are changed
into aperitive crocus martin So that apparently a
certain aeid and nitrous spirit resides in the air.
But when I had seriously considered the matter,
the aeid spirit of nitre seemed to be too ponderous
and fixed to circulate as a whole through the very thin
air. 1Besides, the nitro-aerial salt, whatever it may be,
becomes iood for fireS, and also passes into the blood
of animals by means oi respiration, as will be shown
below. But the aeid spirit ol nitre, being humid and
extremely corrosive, is fitted rather for extinguishing
,ι flame and the life of animals, than for sustaining them.

But although the spirit of nitre does not proeeed ·

altogether from the air, still we must believe that
some part of it originates from the air. For, since
some part of the nitre is derived from the air, as has
been shown above, while the fixed salt, oi which nitre
in part consists, proceeds from the earth, the remainder
oi the nitre, that is to say, its aeid and fiery spirit,
must be derived, in part at least, from the air. But
in order that the aerial part of the spirit of nitre may
be better understood, we must briefly premise the
following.

First, it is, I think, to be admitted that something
aerial, whatever it may be, is necessary to the pro-
duction of any {lame-a fact which the experiments of
Boyle have placed beyond doubt, since it is established
by these experiments that a lighted lamp goes out
much sooner in a glass that contains no air than it
does in the same when filled with air-a clear proof
that the ilame enclosed in the glass goes out, not so
·, much because it is choked, as some have supposed, by
its own soot, as because it is deprived of its aerial
