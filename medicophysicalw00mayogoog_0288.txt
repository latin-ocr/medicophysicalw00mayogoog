flow of the animal spirits or from their inordinate
motion, as will be more fully stated below.

For, indeed, nitro-aerial particles seem in a high
degree to fit the character of animal spirits, inasmuch
as they are very subtle, elastic, and agile. For nitro·
adrial particles are suited for entering on very rapid
and igneous motion, as we have elsewhere shown.
The animal spirits are also of this sort : they pass iu a
moment through the filaments os the nerves, although
these have no visible cavity; and brought at last to
the museleS, cause their instantaneous contractior] by
their own most rapid motion.

Further, the animal spirits, like the nitro-aerial
particles, are so slender that they are at once dissi-
pated and leave no vestige of themselves. Ι further
add that nitro-aerial particles, no less than the animal
spirits themselves, are necessary for the sustenance of
lif. In fact it is difficult to conceive why animals
should have such a necessity of ¹breathing air, so that
not for a moment can they live without it, unless
the nitro-aerial spirits had a primary place inanimal
life and were the animal spirits themselves. Hence,
according as there is need of agreater abundance os
animal spirits, as in violent movements, or of less, as
when the body is at rest, so nitro-aerial particles must
be supplied in greater or in less quantity, and this is
the reason why the respirationis so much increased in
violent movements

Besides, whence, Ι would ask, is a supply of animal
spirits sufficient for continued work obtained unless,
l say, we call to our aid the air, that inexhaustible
fountain? For it is probable that animal spirits are
used up iu the performauce of muscular contractiori
in much greater quantity thau is commonly believed.
For I really do not know how a muscle could contract
