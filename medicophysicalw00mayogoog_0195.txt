On Sal Mirum and Miro-Airial Spin't 159

pass that these contrary salts are kept apart and, as it
were, reconciled by the mediation ol the nitroa'e'rial
particles which are in harmony with both, so that
they are unable mutually to attack or act upon each
other. But when these salts are diluted with water,
they lay aside, at least to some extent, their fiery
particles and become less acrid, as will be apparent
iffixed salts exposed to a hot fire are afterwards dis·
solved in water; for then the salts which the tire has
made extremely acrid and caustic will lay aside their
acridity and return to their original state. Hence
it is that the contrary salts ol lime, after they have
been dissolved in water, are then fit sor acting upon
each other and for mutual effervescence.

And in this we have an explanation of the lact that

quicklime does not become hot when sprinkled with
spirit of wine or other sulphureous liquids of that sort,

as has been said before. For since such liquids are
incapable of dissolving the lixed salt of the lime, they
cannot temper its too acrid and fiery lorce3 yet this
is absolutely necessary for producing its heat.

Ι add, lastly, that the acid salt ol the lime seems to
contract a somewhat dry nature on account ol the
very dry and solid nitro-a'e‘rial particles densely fixed
init 3 whence it is that that aeid spirit can remain so
long in the hottest fire. For the extremely solid
nitro-aerial particles, densely lixed in the acid salt,
make it somewhat rigid, so that its particles cannot

be carried alost by any force of fire. And hence it
is that that acid salt of lime, being of a drier nature,
will not engage with its lixed salt until it has been
dissolved by pouring water upon it.

But yet another difficulty is here presented. For
admitting that contrary salts exist in lime and in the
water in which it has been slakcd‚ how does it
