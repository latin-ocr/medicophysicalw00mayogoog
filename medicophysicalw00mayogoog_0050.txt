On Sal llb'trum and Nino-Amol Spirr't 13

dividual grains, and are not carried to those that are
kindled; so that the flame ol the powder is speedily
extinguished in a vacuum, owing to a break in the
continuity of the igneo-nitrous particles. But how
greatly the elasticity of the air helps to produce lire
will be more fully established by what will be said
below.

From what has been already said, it is,I think, to
some extent proved that nitre contains in itsell the
igneo· -aerial particles· required for the production ol
flame. Wherelore, since some partos nitre is derived
from the air and rgneo- -aerial particles exist in it, it
seems we should affirm the proposition that tlre arnol

part of nitre is nothing else than irs igneo-amal,

particles.

But now since the aerial part of nitre exists in rts
acid spirit, but not in the fixed salt, which, as we have
already shown, forms the rest ol the nitre, we may
conclude that the igneo· -αένία lpart ic les of m tre, twhich
are identical with its aerial part, are haddon ml the¹
spirit of nitre, and constitute its αἰνία l.part

Indeed, it is probable that the spirit of nitre isa
compound, and that some of 1ts particles are flexile,
humid, and of a grosser nature, being apparently
derived frorn terrestrial matter-as I shall endeavour
to show below—but that other particles are rigid,
dry, and extremely subtle, agile, ethereal, and really
igneous, and yet, being united with saline particles in
afluid and moist condition, are unfitted for entering

on a fiery movement, and that these at any rate are
derived from the air.

With regard then to the aerial part of nitrous spirit,
we maintain that it is nothing else than the igneo-
aerial particles which are quite necessary for the
productiori of any flame. Wherelore, let me hence·
