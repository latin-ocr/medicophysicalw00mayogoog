There is certainly , yet another use 01 respiration to
be looked for, one that makes it so necessary. And
what Ι have thought out on so obscure a matter 1511311
shortly state.

Life, if 1 3111 1101 mistaken, consists in the dis·
tribution 01 the animal spirits, and their supply is
most of all required for the beating 01 the heart and
1110 11011 01 blood to the brain. And it appears that
respiration chiefly conduces to the motion 01 the
heart in the manner to be stated elsewhere. For it is
probable that this aerial salt is altogether necessary
101 every movement 01 the museles; so that without
it there could beno pulsation of the heart.

For if it be allowed that the sudden contractiori of
the muscles results from the intermixture of particles
01 (1111010111 kinds, mutually moving each other, 111011
11 15 scarcely to be supposed that the particles 01 both
kinds, by the effervescence 01 which the contraction 01
the muscles is caused, proceed from the mass 01 the
blood; 101 liquids derived 110111 the same source 10-
unite without any effervescence, so that it appears
that something extraneous is required 101 the pro-
duction of the 11101110 fermentation.

We may then suppose that nitro-saline particles
derived from the inspired air constitute the one kind
01 11101110 particles, and that these, when they
meet the others, the saline-sulphureous particles
supplied by the mass 01 the blood and residing 111 the
motor parts, produce the effervescence from which
muscular contraction results, as will be shown more
fully in another place.

And in 1301 motion is produced in the beart in no
different way than in the other museles; but 1 do 1101
think, for the reasons assigned above, that the motive
effervescence takes place in its ventricles but in its
