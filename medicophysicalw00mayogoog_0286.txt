moving themselves in the motor parts. But now ol
these particles by which muscular contractiori is pro-
duced, some, viz. the animal spirits, are brought into
'the motor parts from the brain by means of the
nerves; while others are supplied from the massot

the blood ; as we have shown above. Let us now see
whether the nitro-aesial particles are those motive
particles supplied from¹ the blood, or, on the other
hand, are those coming from the braio—that is, the .
animal spirits. On this point Iwas for some time
in doubt whether the nitro-aerial particles go im·
mediately from the blood into the motor parts3 but
on serious consideration of the matter it seems more
probable that the motive particles supplied from the
blood are ol a saline-sulphureous kind, as to some
extent appears from what has been said above:
whence it follows that the nitro-aerial particles come
Ἴ from the hrain, and consequently are themselves the
animal spirits. Indeed, it is much more probable that
the uitro-a'e'rial spirit should come from the braio
than that saline-sulphureous particles should do so,
For sulphureous particles do not occur at all in the
braio, whereas they are disseminated everywhere
throughout the mass of the muscles. Indeed, sul·
phureous matters seem to be hostile to the animal
spirits; for, liquors lull of volatile sulphur, such as
spirit of wine and the chemical oils of vegetables,
when taken too quicltly disturb the brain and
the animal spirits, and produce not only drunlren·
ness‚ but not rarely madness and fatal convulsions.
While on the contrary the structure ol the brain
seems to be such as to render it specially fit for
separating the nitro-aerial spirit from the blood and
lor preserving it, as will be more fully stated below.

As to the nature of the animal spirits, the authority
