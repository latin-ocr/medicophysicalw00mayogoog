On Sal Mirum and Nr'tro-Alrial Spirat 113

lt is not easy to know whether air of this kind is
really common air or not, but this is certain, that it
will expand like air upon the application of a gentle
hear, and when cooled again will contract. N ay, this
:air is cndowed with elastic force no less than common
-air, as I ascertained by the following experiment.

Let a small glass tube of the diameter ofa goose
¹quill and about four inches long, be hermetically
sealed (as chemists say) at one end ; then leta single
drop of water be dropped in rby the other and open
end, and let it be marked on a paper attached to the
-outside of the glass how much of the space of the
glass the drop occupies; then let a second drop, and
‘then others be dropped into the glass in the same
way as the first, and let the space occupied by them
vbe marked on the aforesaid paper. This done, let the
open end of the glass be fitted into the narrower
opening of another glass open at both ends, and then
let that opening be carefully closed with suitable
‘cement, as is shown in Plate V., Fig. 5. Let the glass,
when prepared in this manner, be so submerged in
water contained ina suitable vessel that, when its
orifice is turned upwards‚ all the air may pass out and
water enter in its place, great care being taken that
the narrow glass be also filled with water. Then let
the glass filled with water be inverted and let it rest
on the bottom of the other vessel, and let things
remain in this condition.

And now the aforesaid air is to be transferred to
this glass in the following manner. Let a small dish,
lbig enough however to receive the mouth of the
-vessel containing the air, be placed under that vessel.
Next let the small dish filled with the aforesaid liquid,

together with the inverted giam, containing the air,
resting upon it, be transferred to the vessel in which
