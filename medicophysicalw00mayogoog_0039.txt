i nitre, sal nitrum seems to be composed ol an extremely
² fiery aeid salt, and, in addition, of an alkali or of purely
saline volatile salt taking the place oi the sal alkali.

’ And this may be ascertained not only from its analysis
but also from the way in which it is produced. As
regards sulphur, which nitre is commonly supposed to
contain, it is our opinion that although nitre defla-
grates readily enough when thrown into the fire,
still a combustible sulphur is in no wise present, as
will be shown below

lf nitre is analysed by distillation, aeid spirit will
pass into the receiver, while fixed nitre, closely re·
sembling sal alkali, will be left in the retort. More·
over, when nitre is melted in a crucible, and sulphur
is thrown in repeatedly until the nitre will deflagrare
no longer, the substance left at the bottom is im-
properly called fixed nitre, since there is fixed only
one element of the nitre, namely, its salt3 the other
clement, namely, the ‚acid spirit, escaping in vapour
during deflagration. Still‚ this spirit may be retained
if deflagration takes place in a tubulated retort with a
receiver attached, or under a bell-jar.

Further, il nitre and tartar, mixed in equal quanti-
ties, are kindled by ignited iron or charcoal‚ fixed salt
equal in amount to the whole of the tartar will be
found after the deflagration, and of this at least some
part is derived from the nitre, and is generally but im·
properly called salt ol tartar; ior, since this fixed salt
is equal to the whole ol the tartar, while the tartar is
not all fixed salt, but consists to a large extent of spirit
and a fetid oil which passes off during the deflagra-
tion, some part oi the remaining salt must accordingly
be due to the nitre.

In the same way, if we look at the mode in which .
nitre is produced, we shall recognise clearly the same
