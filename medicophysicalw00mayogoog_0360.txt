Among the remedies which have been tried in this
disease, the most celebrated is that devised by Boyle,
the name ol it is Ens Veneris. It is composed

of sal armoniae and edulcorated colcothar‚ two or
three times sublimated together; the dose is from
three to six grains taken in a suitable liquid at bed
time. I suppose that the efficiency of this drug
chiefly depends on the sal armoniae, as that is
specially suitable, on account of the extreme tenuity
of its parts, lor removing the obstructions that pro·
duce this disease. And it is likely that the flowers
of sal armoniae will in this disorder be as effectual‚
or even more; for while the sal armoniae is suh-
limed along with colcothar, a narcotic sulphur from
the colcothar, of an earthy or cupreous nature, sub-
limes with the sal armoniae. Now this sort of sulphur
does not seem very suitable for this disease.

An artificial salt, of an ammoniacal nature, and of
great virtue, can be prepared as follows :-
