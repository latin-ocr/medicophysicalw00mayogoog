against the nitro-aerial particles and set them in
igneous motion.

l add further in confirmation of what has been said,
that the nitro-a'e'rial particles to which the elastic force
of the air is due are fixcd in the aerial particles them·
selves and are torn from them by the burning oia
lamp or by the breathing os animals; for that the
nitro-a'e'rial and elastic particles which are lacking in
the aiore-mentioned glass vessels are neither air itsell
nor some material interspersed among its particles, has
been shown above, and therefore it must be concluded
that the elastic particles are implanted in the particles of
the air themselves and constitute their more active part,
and that it is in fine because these are driven out from
the ae'rial particles by the burning of fire or by the
breathing of animals that air becomes quite effete and
destitute of elastic force.

That the igneo-aerial particles are not air itseli pure
and simple, but only its more subtle part, may be
inferred besides from this, that nitro-aerial particles,
whatever they be, exist in nitre and constitute its fiery
and a'e'rial part, as was shown above. But who can
· imagine that air itself resides in such abundance in
nitre as is required for its burning in a place void oi
air? Ii spirit of nitre be poured upon any fixed salt
when taken fresh from the fire, nitre will be produced
by their union ς but it is not to be supposed that air is
present in such quantity in either of these principles,
nor can we believe that air coalesces along with
these principles in the generation of nitre. Nor is it
probable that air without any force applied to it would
condense to such an extent as would have to be
supposed in the case ol nitre il its burning resulted
from air residing in it. For to the production of so
impetuous a flame as is produced by a small morsel ol
