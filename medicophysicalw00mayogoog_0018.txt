Pseface v

Opzin'ons. It is dated Oxlord,12th February 1790,

two years before his resignation of the readership in
chemistry. Besides Beddoes we have Dr J. B. A.
*Scheren physician in Vienna, who in 1793 published
Beroen, dass J. Mayow vor 100 Jahren den Grund
aur antzpltlogzlrtrschen Chemie und Plrysrologie gelegt
hat, and also G. D. Yeats, M.B. of Herttord College‚
Oxford, physician at Bedford, who in 1798 published
Observabam on the claim of the Moderns to some
Discoverres in Chemistry and Physiology.

Beddoes quotes from Blumenbach’s Instz'tutr'oncs
Physrologicae, 1787, the following remarkable
passage: “Magna jam pars memorabilium borum
phaenomenorum‚” says he, speaking of respiration,
“quibus nuperis lustris et physica de aeribus factitiis
disciplina et physiologia negotii respirationis tam
egregie ditata et illustrata est, jam ante centum et
quod excurrit annos innotuit acutissimi ingenii
medico Joanni Mayow‚ cujus de sal-nitro et spiritu
nitro-aereo (quo nempe nomine dephlogisticatum
aerem insignivit) tractatum, Oxon. 8vo editum,
magna cum voluptate legi et relegi.”

But these attempts to make Mayow and his work
known to the scientific and medical world were not
crowned with much success.

Mayow is indeed mentioned, and his work is
discussed‚ in most books on the History of Chemistry ;
but as far as we bave been able to discover, not many
chemists 0r physiologists have made anything like an
intimate personal acquaintance with his writings.
Quite recently a considerable part of the treatise on
nitre hasbeen translated into German and published
by Prof. Donnan (Ostwald's Klnssiker der exaltan
Wzssensclzaflen,Nr.123‚ 1901). We had begun the
translation some time previously, but soon saw that it
