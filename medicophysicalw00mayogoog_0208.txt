been slaked, or in lye, when the sulphur is precipi-
tated from thern by the addition of any aeid liquid.

Iam aware that the water of these thermal springs
immediately becomes white if salt of tartar‚ or a
simply saline volatile salt, be put into it, as was
already remarked. But this white colour is caused by
the precipitation not of sulphur but of' a certain
stony or aluminous matter, just as happens to water
which has slaked quicklime·when any fixed salt is
mixed with it, though it is not to be supposed that
sulphur is dissolved in it. For if sulphur were boiled
in the water in which quicklime has been slaked, the
water would not become white, as before, on the
addition of fixed salt, but would do so on the addition
of aeid. So that fixed salts appear manifestly to be
fitted for dissolving sulphur but not for precipitating
it. Wherefore if the waters of the thermal springs
were imbued with sulphur, they would not be
precipitated as they are by a simply saline salt but by
an aeid. And indeed the sulphur precipitated by
them would manifest itself bya fetid odour, but this
does not at all happen.

1 further add that some acid or aluminous salt
seems to preponderate in these thermal waters, so
that they are quite incapable of dissolving sulphur.
“ Nay, if common sulphur be boiled in the said
waters‚ these waters will not be at all tinged with
the yellow colour of sulphur, nor can sulphur be
precipitated in any way from the said decoction‚ as 1
have found by repeated trials. And indeed I am
greatly surprised that the distinguished Willis in his
Treatise on the Heat of the Blood‚ has asserted
that sulphur can be dissolved when boiled in the
water of the said thermal springs, just as in water that
has slaked quicklime. But if sulphur ever appears to
