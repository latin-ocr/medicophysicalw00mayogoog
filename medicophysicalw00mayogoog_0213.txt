steeped ina sort of molsture to the depth of several
feet, and that aqueous particles escape from it only
very slowly. And hence it is that the ground
wet with showers can be dried up only after a long
time. lt corroborates this view that if a pair of ctus,
several leet deep and of sufficient length, are dug in
almost any soil so that they meet at their lowest part,
the drops ol waterflowiug here and there from the banks
and uniting at last at the bottom‚ will make an artificial
spring or rather rivulet. And this shows why it is that
spring-waters well forth with greater or less abundance
according as the weather has been wet or dry. Now
this would by no means be the case if springs were
derived from the sea and not from the air.

Further‚ it must, l think, be granted that nearly all
the mountains in every part of the world consist
of saline-sulphureous matters such as vitriolic or
’ aluminous marchasites and the like.

Ι remark, in the last place, that if saline-sulphureous
earth of this sort be wetted with rain-water it will
effervesce and grow warm. For if marchasites or
saline-sulphureous masses. such as vitriolic and similar
salts are produced from, be exposed to moist air and
rainy weather they will soon effervesce markedly.
Nay‚ if any saline-sulphureous mineral‚ recently dug
up, is wetted with rain-water it will after a short time
effervesce aud grow warm.

Let us next inquire why saline-sulphureous minerals
of this sort effervesce when wetted with rain-water,
for it is to be supposed that the heat of the thermal
springs results from the same cause. And we may
indeed suppose that the adrial particles which are
mingled with almost all water, but especially with
rain-water. contribute in no small degree to produce
the said effervescence. For that air is mixed with
