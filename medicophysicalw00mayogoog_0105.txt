hollow of the cupping-glass by the pressure of the sur-
roundiug air. But now let us inquire why the space
within the cupping-glass becomes almost empty
immediately upon the extinction of the flame. One
might readily say here that the fiery and aerial par-
ticles are agitated in the flame with a very rapid motion
and are much rarefied, but that alter the extinction ol
the flame they cease from their movement and are con·
densed, so that these particles are no longer able to
resist the pressure of the surroundiug air. But this
answer does not seem quite satisfactory, for it is prob·
able that air is largely mixed with the flame, since it
supplies it with nutriment‚ so that not even the
smallest partos the flame is altogether destitute ol air.
But if the air were distributed abundantly enough in
the flame, it does not appear that it would be condensed
after the extinction ol the flame to the extent required
lor rendering the space in the cupping-glass so empty.

Wherelore I think it should be maintained that the
air mixed with the flame is, by the burning ol the
flame, quickly deprived os its nitro-aerial and elastic
particles, so that this air not only becomes unfit for
sustaining fire but also loses in part its elasticity.
Hence when a flame enclosed in a glass vessel has
exhausted the nitro-a'e'rial particles of the air, it soon
goes out and the space contained within is like a
vacuum, not only on account of the diminished motion
ol the igneous particles, but partly also from the lack
of elastic particles, as will appear more evident from
the following experimeuts. ’

For instance, let a burning candle be placed in water
so that the wick may stand about six finger-breadths
above the water, and then let an inverted cupping-
glass of sufficient height be put over the light and
plunged immediately into the water surroundiug the
