they, when violently contracted, forcibly raise up the
parts annexed to thern, as any one can feel for
himself when he jumps. But this is to be noted
here, that these bones along with the parts attached
to them are not carried straight up by the contraction
of the said muscles, but that the thighs are carried up
and forwards, while on the other hand the back is
carried up and backward, as is made clear in the
figure; yet so that in the motion of animals moving
κ straight up, the force which carries some parts
forwards and that which carries other parts backwards,
being in equilibrium, mutually destroy one another,
while the other motion by which all the parts are
carried upwards is unimpaired; but as the animals
jump forwards or jump backwards so must the force
by which some parts are directed lorwards, or that by
which others are directed backwards, prevail.

But that this may be still more clearly made
apparent, I say the said extensor muscles raise the
animal alost in the same way as anything is thrown
from the hand.

For as to the force impressed upon things projected,
it is not to be thought of as anything else than
motion alone: when athing is once set in motion it
will continue in it until lt is retarded by bodies in the
way, or by the gravity inherent in itself ; for, since
(as has been noted by the acute Descartes), if a thing
is at rest we do not believe that it will ever begin to
move unless it is impelled to do so by some cause,
so there is no reason why we should suppose that if
a thing is moving it should intermit its motion of its
own accord, and not as hindered by something else.
For as inanimate things obviously cannot dispose ol

themselves, but are altogether subject to the disposi-
tion of others, they must continue in the state in
