216 Mayou ·

doubted that the vena cava also exists from the very
commencement of life. For why should not Nature
be as ready to form the vena cava as that long circuit
of umbilical vessels which are quite useless after birth
and have to be destroyed?

Wherefore‚ since the fonctions hitherto assigned to
the umbilical arteries do not appear to be suitable and
real, we may hold with divine old Hippocrates that
in the embryo the umbilicus supplies the place of
respirati0n‚ which is also the opinion of the learned
Everard.

ButI cannot agree with Everard in the reason he
assigns for setting up respiration in the uterus. For
this learned man thinks that the blood of the infant is
conveyed through the long circuit ol the umbilical
vessels in order that it may be cooled in its journey.
But indeed it is by no means to be believed that such
a cooling of the blood takes place in the very warm
uterus. And even though there were such cooling, it
would serve in no way the purpose of respiration, for,
as we have shown elsewhere, this contributes rather
to the heating than to the cooling ol the blood.

But now that we may prepare the way for our
opinion as to respiration in the uterus, we observe, in
the first place, that it is probable that the albuminous
juice exuding from the impregnated uterus is stored
with no small abundance of a'e'rial substance, as may
be inferred from its white colour and frothy character.
And in further indication of this, the primogenial
juices of the egg, which have a great resemblance
to the seminal juice ol the uterus, appear to abound
in air particles. For if the white or the yolk of au
egg be put in a glass from which the air is exhausted

by means of Boyle’s pump, these liquids will im·
mediately become very frothy and swell into an
