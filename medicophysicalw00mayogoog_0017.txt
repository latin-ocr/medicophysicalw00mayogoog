elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London,
having been proposed by Hooke.

His philosophica] writings consist of five treatises,
written in Latin. Two of these-

De respiratione ,· and
De rachitide
—were first published at Oxford in 1668. A revised
edition of these two, together with the other three- ,
De sal-nitro et spiritu miro-aereo,-
De respiratione foetus in utero et ovo,· and
De motu masculari et spiritibus anamalibus
-n'as published at Oxford in 1674.

Mayow was thus twenty-five years old when he
published his tracts on respiration and on rickets,
and he died at the early age ol thirty-six.

Mayow's works were not much noticed in his own
time, and speedily fell into almost total oblivion,
Hales, in his Vegetable Staticks (London, 1727), being
the only author who refers to his writings in the
earlier part of the eighteenth century. They were
reprinted in Latin at the Hague in 1681 and at
Geneva in 1685. A German translation appeared at
Jena in 1799 and a French translation at Paris in
1840.

Alter the great revolution in chemical theory which
followed the discovery of oxygen, Mayow’s book was
discovered in old libraries, where it had remained
disregarded for a hundred years; and those who
discovered it were astonished to see that the new
chemistry, which was rapidly conquering the scientific
world, was to be found in this old book. As far as we
know, Dr Thomas Beddoes was the first distinctly to-
recognise Mayow’s claim. Dr Beddoes published his
discovery of Mayow in a letter to Dr Edmund
Goodwyn, with an Analysis of Mayow’s Chemical
